RECIPE#1- Bolognese Borlotti Beans
Serves 4
Ingredients:
- 1 cup dried cranberry or pinto beans
- 2 to 4 cups homemade chicken or vegetable stock or lower-salt canned broth
- 1 tsp. salt; more to taste
- 2 Tbs. olive oil
- 1/2 medium onion, coarsely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 12 oz. fresh fettuccine, cut diagonally into 2-inch lengths
- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped sun-dried tomatoes (drained if packed in oil)
- 2 oz. prosciutto, sliced thin and cut into 1/2-inch strips
- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Small block of Parmesan, for shaving (optional)

Instructions:
1. Rinse the beans, pick them over well, and put them in a large saucepan with just enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, cover, and allow to sit for 1 hour. Add more water if necessary to cover the beans.
2. Heat the oven to 350°F. Drain the beans and put them in an ovenproof casserole. Add enough stock to cover them, cover the casserole with a lid or foil, and bake the beans until tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. After 1 hour, add 1 tsp. salt and check the stock level. The beans should still be covered by stock; add more if necessary. When the beans are tender, strain off the liquid and measure it; add enough stock to make 2 cups. Recombine the liquid and beans and set aside.
3. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Sauté the onion until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the beans and their liquid to the sautéed onion and garlic. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes to combine the flavors; remove from the heat.
4. Meanwhile, cook the pasta until tender, drain it, and add it immediately to the beans. Stir in the tomatoes and prosciutto, reserving some of each for garnish. Toss with the parsley and grated Parmesan. Add salt and pepper to taste.
5. Arrange the pasta and beans in a serving bowl. Top with the reserved tomatoes and prosciutto. With a sharp knife or vegetable peeler, shave thin curls from the block of Parmesan and scatter them on top. Serve immediately.

RECIPE#2- Pasta Shells with Chickpeas, Fennel, Tomatoes & Prosciutto
Serves 4
Ingredients:
- 4 salt-packed anchovies, boned and rinsed (or 8 oil-cured anchovies)
- 16 large fresh basil leaves, washed and thoroughly dried
- 4 large cloves garlic, peeled
- 5 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 lb. medium-sized ribbed pasta shells
- 1 1/2 cups cooked, drained chickpeas
- 1 small bulb fennel, trimmed and coarsely chopped (about 2 cups)
- 12 cherry tomatoes, cut into quarters or eighths, depending on size
- 1/4 lb. sliced prosciutto, cut into wide strips
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan (optional)

Instructions:
1. Finely chop the anchovies, basil, and garlic and transfer to a small mixing bowl. Whisk in the olive oil and set aside.
2. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil and cook the shells. When the pasta is almost al dente, add the chickpeas to warm them. As soon as the pasta is al dente, drain it and the chickpeas well.
3. Pour the olive oil mixture into the pot, add the pasta and chickpeas, and toss thoroughly with the fennel, tomatoes, and prosciutto. Season with pepper and let the pasta rest for 3 to 5 minutes, loosely covered. Toss with the grated Parmesan, if you like, and serve.
