RECIPE#1- Penne with Sausage, Chard & Pine Nuts
Serves: 2
Ingredients:
- 1 Tbs. olive oil; more as needed
- 5 oz. sweet Italian sausage (about 2 sausage links), casings removed, meat crumbled
- 1 small red onion, chopped
- 1 small bunch red, green, or yellow Swiss chard, tougher stems removed and leaves roughly chopped
- 2 small cloves garlic, minced
- Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable stock or dry white wine
- 8 oz. dried penne or fusilli
- 1 Tbs. balsamic vinegar; more to taste
- 1/4 cup pine nuts, lightly toasted
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan

Instructions:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for cooking the pasta.
2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up and stirring with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the sausage and set aside.
3. If the pan seems dry, add enough oil so there’s about 3 Tbs. fat in the pan. Return the pan to medium heat, add the onion, and cook until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon.
4. Add the chard, garlic, and pepper flakes, season with salt and pepper, and toss until the chard begins to sizzle, about 1 minute.
5. Add the stock, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chard is tender, 6 to 8 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, cook the pasta until just tender. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and then drain the pasta, leaving drops of water clinging to it.
7. Add the pasta and ¼ cup of the cooking water to the skillet, using more of the water if needed.
8. Return the sausage to the pan and add the balsamic vinegar. Heat gently for a few minutes to let the flavors meld.
9. Add the pine nuts and half of the Parmesan, and taste for salt and pepper. Add a bit more of the cooking water if the pan seems dry.
10. Serve warm, passing the remaining Parmesan cheese at the table.

RECIPE#2- Gemelli with Cauliflower, Scallions & Green Olives
Serves: 2
Ingredients:
- 1/2 head cauliflower, cut into large florets
- 3 to 4 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 3 scallions, white parts finely chopped, greens cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- Generous pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
- 6 to 8 anchovy fillets, chopped
- 8 oz. dried gemelli, fusilli, or cavatappi
- 1/2 cup fresh, slightly coarse breadcrumbs, toasted in a 400°F oven for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden
- 1/2 cup cracked green olives, pitted and coarsely chopped

Instructions:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the cauliflower into the boiling water and cook until the florets offer little resistance when pierced with the tip of a knife, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the cauliflower from the pot and drain it.
2. Return the water to a boil for cooking the pasta.
3. In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbs. of the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and scallion whites and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the pepper flakes and anchovies, crushing them with a wooden spoon, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat while you cook the pasta.
5. Just before the pasta is done, return the skillet to medium-high heat and add the cauliflower and half of the breadcrumbs. Cook, tossing once or twice, until heated through.
6. When the pasta is just tender, reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta, leaving drops of water clinging to it.
7. Add the pasta and 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water to the skillet, using more or less as needed. Stir in the olives and the scallion greens. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil to taste.
8. Heat gently for a few minutes so that flavors meld. Taste for salt and pepper.
9. Serve warm, passing the remaining breadcrumbs at the table.
