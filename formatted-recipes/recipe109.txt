RECIPE#1- Orecchiette with Roasted Cauliflower, Arugula & Prosciutto

- Serving Size: 4
- Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt
  - 1/2 medium head cauliflower, cored and cut into 3/4-inch florets (3 1/2 cups)
  - 1 pint grape tomatoes
  - 3 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 9 large fresh sage leaves
  - 4 large cloves garlic, peeled
  - 6 thin slices prosciutto (about 4 oz.)
  - 12 oz. dried orecchiette
  - 5 oz. baby arugula (5 lightly packed cups)
  - 3/4 cup grated Parmigiano-reggiano
  
- Instructions:
  1. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F.
  2. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
  3. Toss the cauliflower, tomatoes, oil, salt, and pepper on a rimmed baking sheet; spread in a single layer. Roast, stirring once or twice, until the cauliflower begins to turn golden and tender, about 15 minutes.
  4. Meanwhile, pulse the sage and garlic in a food processor until minced. Add the prosciutto and pulse until coarsely chopped. Once the cauliflower is golden, toss the herb mixture into the vegetables and continue to roast until fragrant and the cauliflower is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
  5. Cook the orecchiette until al dente, 9 to 10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta-cooking water. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Stir in the roasted cauliflower mixture, arugula, cheese, and enough pasta water to moisten. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

RECIPE#2- Farfalle in a Broth of Wild Mushrooms and Browned Shallots

- Serving Size: 4
- Ingredients:
  - 6 oz. fresh shiitake mushrooms
  - 1/4 lb. fresh oyster mushrooms
  - 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 3/4 lb. dried farfalle
  - 4 shallots (about 3 oz. total), sliced crosswise into 1/4- to 1/8-inch-thick rings
  - 1/4 cup dry sherry
  - 3 cups lower-salt canned chicken broth
  - 2 tsp. fresh thyme leaves, chopped
  - 1/4 tsp. Tabasco® sauce
  - 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-reggiano
  
- Instructions:
  1. Put a large pot of salted water on to boil.
  2. Stem the shiitake and oyster mushrooms and thinly slice the caps. Heat 2 Tbs. of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the sliced mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing occasionally, until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
  3. Put the pasta in the water.
  4. Add the remaining 2 Tbs. oil and the shallots to the skillet. Season with salt and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the shallots brown and soften, 2 to 4 minutes. Raise the heat to high, add the sherry, and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan, until the sherry is almost completely boiled off, about 30 seconds. Add the chicken broth. After 2 minutes, return the mushrooms to the pan, reduce the heat to medium, and cook the broth another 2 minutes. Sprinkle in the thyme and Tabasco and taste for salt and pepper.
  5. Finish cooking the farfalle until it’s just tender, about 11 minutes total. Drain and put back in the pasta pot. Pour the broth and mushrooms over the pasta and stir well. Serve immediately in bowls with a generous sprinkling of the Parmigiano.

RECIPE#3- Pasta with Pumpkin, Sausage & Cavolo Nero

- Serving Size: 6
- Ingredients:
  - Kosher salt
  - 1 lb. sweet Italian sausage, casings removed if using links
  - 1 Tbs. olive oil (optional)
  - 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
  - 3 cups 3/4-inch-diced peeled, seeded pumpkin
  - 1/4 cup dry white wine
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 tsp. dried marjoram
  - 1 1/2 cups lower-salt chicken broth
  - 10 oz. cavolo nero (also called Lacinato, black, or dinosaur kale), trimmed, ribs removed, and leaves cut into 1-inch pieces
  - 8 oz. dried campanelle
  - 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-reggiano
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  
- Instructions:
  1. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat.
  2. In a heavy-duty 12-inch skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until mostly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Push the sausage toward the edge of the skillet and add the olive oil if the center of the pan is dry (this will depend on the amount of fat in the sausage). Add the onion and cook until golden and the sausage is well-browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in the pumpkin, wine, garlic, and marjoram and cook until the wine evaporates, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 3/4 cup of the broth and cook until the pumpkin is almost tender, about 8 minutes. Add the kale and the remaining 3/4 cup broth, cover, and cook until the pumpkin and kale are tender, about 4 minutes.
  3. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in the boiling water according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water and then drain well. Add the pasta to the skillet with enough of the pasta water to coat the pasta and vegetables generously. Stir in the Parmigiano and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with additional Parmigiano.
