RECIPE#1-PASTA Ravioli

Ingredients:
- 18 oz. (4 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour or “00” flour, or a combination
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 tsp. kosher salt 

Instructions:
1. Dump the flour in a pile on a work surface. Make a deep, wide well in the center and pour in the eggs, oil, and salt. Mix the eggs with a fork, staying in the center and being careful that the eggs don’t breach the wall. Little by little, mix in flour from the sides until the dough starts to move as a unit and is too stiff to mix with a fork. Now mix with your hand, incorporating flour to stiffen the dough. When it doesn’t easily absorb more flour, set the dough aside.
2. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until it’s a smooth, homogeneous ball of dough, about 5 minutes. Wrap the dough loosely in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours.
3. Use a pasta machine to make sheets of dough. Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Flatten one piece with your hand and run it through the widest setting on the machine twice. Set the rollers to the next narrower setting and pass the dough through twice. Continue notching down by one setting and passing the dough through two times. When you can see the shape and shadow of your hand through the sheet, stop rolling. Fill and cut as instructed.

Prep Time: 1 hour (includes refrigeration)
Cook Time: Varies depending on filling and cooking method
Total Time: 1 hour (plus additional time for filling and cooking)

RECIPE#2- Pasta Linguine with Leeks, Prosciutto & Lemon

Ingredients:
- 4 oz. thinly sliced prosciutto, excess fat trimmed and reserved, lean part cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips
- 2 Tbs. unsalted butter
- 3 small leeks, white and tender green parts only, sliced (about 2 cups) and well rinsed
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 lb. dried linguine
- 1 Tbs. lemon zest
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 3/4 cup walnuts, roughly chopped and lightly toasted

Instructions:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for cooking the pasta. Chop the trimmed prosciutto fat, if using, and put it in a large skillet with the butter. Heat over medium until the butter is melted and the fat is translucent.
2. Add the leeks, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add the prosciutto, stirring to distribute, and then add the cream. Reduce the heat to low and let heat gently, uncovered, while you cook the pasta until just tender.
3. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta, leaving drops of water clinging to it. Add the pasta and half of the reserved pasta cooking water to the skillet. Stir in the lemon zest and juice; season abundantly with black pepper. Heat gently for a few minutes to let the pasta absorb the sauce, adding more pasta cooking water if needed to thin it. Add the walnuts and taste for salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

RECIPE#3- Campanelle with Sausage and Leeks

Ingredients:
- Salt
- 2 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil
- 3/4 lb. sweet Italian sausage (casings removed), crumbled
- 2 large leeks, trimmed, light green and white parts cut into 1/2-inch pieces, washed well, and drained
- 1 Tbs. finely chopped shallot
- 2 Tbs. unsalted butter
- 1 cup frozen young peas, defrosted and drained, or 1 cup fresh peas, blanched in boiling water for 2 minutes
- 1 cup homemade chicken stock or lower-salt canned chicken broth
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 lb. dried campanelle or other shaped dried pasta
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; more for serving (optional)

Instructions:
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add about 1 Tbs. salt. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook the sausage, breaking up the lumps until golden, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the leeks and cook, stirring, until soft, about 8 minutes. Stir in the shallot and cook for 1 minute. Add 1 Tbs. of butter, the peas, and the stock. Heat to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, cover the skillet, and set aside; keep warm.
3. Meanwhile, cook the campanelle until al dente, about 12 minutes. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot over low heat. Add the sausage and leek sauce to the pasta and toss well. Remove the pot from the heat, add the remaining 1 Tbs. butter and the grated cheese; toss well. Transfer to a warmed serving platter or individual bowls. Serve immediately, with more grated cheese on the side if desired.
