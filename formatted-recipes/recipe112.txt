RECIPE#1 - Asparagus Ravioli with Brown Butter Sauce

Serving Size: Makes 18 ravioli, serves 4 as a main dish or 6 as an appetizer

Ingredients:
- Sea salt
- 1 lb. thick asparagus, trimmed, spears cut into 1-inch pieces, and tips reserved
- 6 Tbs. mascarpone
- 1/3 cup whole-milk ricotta
- 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-reggiano; more for serving
- 1 tsp. anchovy paste
- 1/2 tsp. minced garlic
- Pinch of cayenne
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 36 wonton wrappers
- 4 oz. (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup blanched almonds, chopped
- Finely grated lemon zest

Instructions:
1. Bring a medium pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat. Have ready a medium bowl of ice water.
2. Boil the asparagus tips until tender but still bright green, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the ice water and then to a small bowl. Cook and cool the asparagus spears in the same manner and dry them on paper towels.
3. In a food processor (or by hand), finely chop 1 1/2 cups of the asparagus spears and transfer to a medium bowl. Add the remaining spears to the tips.
4. Add mascarpone, ricotta, Parmigiano, anchovy paste, garlic, and cayenne to the chopped asparagus. Mix well and season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. Arrange 18 wonton wrappers on a work surface. Put 1 level Tbs. of the asparagus filling in the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of each with water using a pastry brush. Top each with another wrapper and press the edges firmly to seal.
6. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a rolling boil over high heat.
7. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat and add the almonds. Cook until the butter turns light brown, about 6 minutes, and then transfer to a small bowl.
8. Add the ravioli to the boiling water. When they rise to the surface after about 1 minute, transfer them to warm plates or pasta bowls.
9. Spoon the brown butter mixture over the ravioli and top with the reserved asparagus pieces, a grinding of pepper, a sprinkle of Parmigiano, and a little lemon zest before serving.

RECIPE#2 - Spaghetti with Green Garlic and Olive Oil

Serving Size: Serves 2

Ingredients:
- Kosher salt
- 2 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 oz. green garlic, green parts cut into 3-inch julienne strands, and white parts thinly sliced
- 6 oz. thin spaghetti
- 2 Tbs. freshly grated Parmigiano-reggiano; more for serving
- Freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
1. Bring 3 quarts of well-salted water to a boil in a large pot over high heat.
2. Heat the oil in a 10-inch straight-sided sauté pan over low heat. Add the green garlic and salt, and stir to coat. Cover and cook, stirring frequently, until wilted and softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.
3. Cook the spaghetti until just al dente, about 1 minute less than the package instructions. Set aside about 1/2 cup of the cooking water and drain the pasta.
4. Return the sauté pan to low heat. Add the spaghetti and 1/4 cup of the cooking water; toss well. Add the Parmigiano and 2 Tbs. of the cooking water; toss again. Season to taste with salt and pepper, adding the remaining water if the pasta seems dry.
5. Serve in heated pasta bowls, sprinkled with additional Parmigiano.
