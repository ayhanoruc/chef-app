S E R V E S  2  O R  3
 1  bunch broccoli raab, washed 
 11/2  Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil; 
more for drizzling
 1  small onion, finely chopped
 11/2  to 2 tsp. finely chopped  
fresh rosemary
 2  cloves garlic, minced, plus  
1 whole clove to rub on  
the toast
  Crushed red pepper flakes
 1  15-oz. can cannellini beans, 
rinsed and drained
   Kosher salt and freshly ground 
black pepper
 2  to 4 thick slices sturdy 
country-style bread,  
preferably sourdough
   Lemon wedges or  
red-wine vinegarThis classic appetizer can be 
varied to suit your taste (see the 
sidebar below). 
1. Peel the larger stems of the 
broccoli raab and slice them 
thinly. Chop the leaves coarsely. 
Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet. 
Add the onion and rosemary 
and cook over medium-high 
heat until the onion softens and 
begins to color, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and a pinch or two  
of red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute. Add the chopped raab leaves  
and stems along with 1 cup of water and cook, stirring occasionally, until the 
raab is wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the beans (and more water as needed) 
until the greens are cooked, about another 15 minutes. Season well with salt 
and pepper. 
2. Meanwhile, toast the bread on the grill or under the broiler. Rub one side of 
the toast with the reserved garlic clove. Set a slice or two of bread on each 
plate. Spoon the beans and greens over the toast. Drizzle olive oil liberally over 
the beans and greens. T op with a squeeze of lemon juice or a splash of red-
wine vinegar. —Deborah Madison

 4  S TA R T E R S ,  S A L A D S  &  S O U P S•  Cover the toast with a layer of shaved Parmesan, Asiago, or 
Monterey Dry Jack cheese before adding the greens and 
beans. Or shave thin flakes of cheese over the sandwich. 
•  Cover the toast with a layer of thinly sliced fresh mozzarella 
cheese and broil it until the cheese bubbles and melts. T op 
with the beans and greens. 
•  Try milder greens, such as chard or spinach. Collards are also 
good, but they’ll take longer to cook. 
•  Try French green lentils in place of the beans and garnish with 
a sieved or crumbled hard-cooked egg. VariationsS TA R T E R S ,  S A L A D S  &  S O U P S   5cherry tomatoes stuffed with 
mozzarella & basil
M A K E S  A B O U T  3  D O Z E N  H O R S 
D ’ O E U V R E S ;  S E R V E S  1 0  T O  1 2
 1/2  lb. fresh mozzarella, cut  
into tiny dice (to yield about  
11/4 cups)
 3  Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil
 1 / 3  cup coarsely chopped fresh 
basil leaves
 1/2  tsp. freshly grated lemon zest 
(from about 1/4 lemon)
   Kosher salt and freshly ground 
black pepper
 1  pint (about 18) cherry  
tomatoes, rinsed and stems 
removedThis is a spin-off of the classic tomato, mozzarella, and basil salad called 
Insalata Caprese .
1. In a medium bowl, stir the cheese, oil, basil, zest, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. 
pepper. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours before assembling.
2. When ready to assemble, slice each tomato in half (either direction is all 
right) and scoop out the insides with the small end of a melon baller or a 
teaspoon. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Invert onto a paper towel and let the 
tomatoes drain for 15 minutes.
3. Fill each tomato half with a scant teaspoon of the cheese mixture and 
arrange on a serving tray. Serve immediately as an hors d’oeuvre, or wrap and 
refrigerate for up to 2 hours. —Jessica Bard
