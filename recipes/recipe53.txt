SE R V E S  4
 1  lb. dried spaghetti or other 
pasta
  Kosher salt
 21/2  cups Summer Tomato Sauce 
(recipe on the facing page)
 2  Tbs. chopped fresh basil 
leaves
   Freshly grated Parmigiano-
Reggiano, for servingServe the fresh tomato sauce over pasta the first night you make it; you’ll have 
plenty left for three more great weeknight meals. 
Cook the pasta in boiling salted water according to the package directions; 
drain. In a small saucepan, heat the tomato sauce over medium-low heat until 
just simmering. Off the heat, stir in the basil and salt to taste. T oss the pasta 
with the sauce and sprinkle with the Parmigiano. —D omenica Marchetti

  Salt 
 8  Tbs. unsalted butter, cut  
into pieces
 8  large, fresh sage leaves
 1  cup heavy cream
 1/2  cup homemade chicken stock 
or lower-salt canned chicken 
broth
  Freshly ground black pepper
 1/2  lb. dried fettuccine
 1/4  cup freshly grated  
Parmigiano-Reggiano
 2  oz. ricotta salata, preferably 
smoked (ricotta affumicata), 
cut into thin shards with a 
vegetable peeler or on the side 
of a box graterCream sauces go well with all kinds of pasta shapes, but this sauce holds 
up especially well to a hearty flat ribbon pasta. Ricotta salata is a smooth, 
firm, pure-white Italian sheep’s milk cheese. Ricotta affumicata is a lightly 
smoked version of the same cheese. Both are available at specialty grocery 
stores, cheese shops, and Italian groceries. If you can’t find them, increase the 
amount of Parmigiano-Reggiano. 
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add about 1 Tbs. salt. In a large skillet, 
combine the butter and sage. Stir over low heat until the butter has melted. 
Add the cream and stock and bring to a boil; cook until the mixture lightly 
coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. 
Remove the sauce from the heat but keep it warm.
2. Meanwhile, cook the fettuccine until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. With tongs, 
lift the pasta from the pot, let it drain for a moment over the boiling water, and 
then add it to the sauce in the skillet. (Alternatively, drain the pasta in a colan-
der and add it to the sauce.) Cook gently on low for a few minutes for the pasta 
to absorb the sauce. Remove the pasta from the heat and stir in the grated 
cheese; season amply with pepper. Serve in warmed bowls topped with the 
shaved ricotta. —Lidia Bastianich

SE R V E S  4 , W I T H  LE F T O V E R S
 8  lb. ripe Roma tomatoes  
(about 40)
 1/4  cup extra-virgin olive oil
 3  medium cloves garlic, crushed 
 2 tsp. kosher salt1. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Rinse the tomatoes in cold water. 
With a paring knife, cut an X into the bottom of each tomato. (This will make 
it easier to peel the tomatoes once they’re blanched.) Carefully lower about 
10 tomatoes into the boiling water and leave them for 20 to 30 seconds. Use 
a slotted spoon to move them to a large bowl filled with ice water. Continue 
blanching the tomatoes in batches and transferring them to the ice water.
2. Use a paring knife and your fingers to remove the skin from the tomatoes—
it should peel off easily. Cut the tomatoes lengthwise into quarters, core, 
and remove the seeds. Coarsely chop the tomatoes and transfer them to  
a bowl.
3. Heat the oil and the garlic in a 5- to 6-quart heavy-duty pot over medium-
low heat until the garlic begins to sizzle and very  lightly browns, 3 to 4 minutes. 
Carefully pour in the tomatoes. Raise the heat to medium high and bring the 
tomatoes to a boil. Stir in the salt, reduce the heat to medium, and let the 
sauce simmer, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have broken down 
and the sauce has thickened, about 1 hour. Remove from the heat and 
discard the garlic.
