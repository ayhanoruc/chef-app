creamy polenta
MA K E S  ABOU T  61/2  CUP S ; 
S E RV E S  6 T O  8
 3  cups water
 2  cups coarse-gr ound polenta
 3  cups cold milk
 11/2  tsp. salt
 1/2   cup freshly grated Parmesan
 2  Tbs. unsalted butterThis simple polenta side dish needs only a bit of butter to enrich it. 
Over high heat, bring the water to a boil. Combine the polenta with the milk 
and salt and stir until smooth. Slowly add this mixture to the boiling water, 
stirring constantly. Cook, stirring, until the polenta begins to thicken. Reduce 
the heat to medium and continue to cook until the polenta begins to bubble 
and pop. Reduce the heat to low, add the Parmesan and butter, and continue 
stirring until the polenta begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 
10 minutes for soft polenta or about 20 minutes for firm. Serve immediately 
as a side dish or mold into a dish and let stand to make firmer polenta.

S E R V E S  8
 2  Tbs. olive oil
 1  green bell pepper, diced
 1  onion, diced
 1  clove garlic, minced
 1/4   lb. mushrooms, diced
 1/2   lb. sweet Italian sausage, 
casings removed
 2  28-oz. cans crushed tomatoes
   Salt and freshly ground black 
pepper
 1/4   cup chopped fresh basil
 1/4   cup chopped fresh flat-leaf 
parsley
 1   recipe Creamy Polenta (on the 
facing page), molded into a 
13x9-inch dish 
 4  oz. fresh mozzarella, shredded
 1 / 3  cup freshly grated ParmesanSlices of firm polenta take the 
place of pasta in this rustic 
“lasagne.” 
MAKE THE SAUCE
1. In a large frying pan, heat the 
oil over medium heat. Add the 
pepper, onion, and garlic and 
cook until the vegetables begin to 
soften, about 5 minutes. Add the 
mushrooms and crumble in the 
sausage; cook  until the sausage is 
no longer pink, about 5 minutes longer. 
2. Stir in the tomatoes, and season with about 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. 
Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thick and flavorful, 45 to  
50 minutes. Stir in the herbs. T aste for seasoning and add more salt and 
pepper if needed.
ASSEMBLE THE LASAGNE
Heat the oven to 350°F . Unmold the polenta onto a work surface, cut it in 
half crosswise, and slice each half horizontally with a long, thin knife. Spread 
1/2 cup of the tomato sauce in the bottom of the 13x9-inch pan and put 
half the polenta on top. Layer with about 2 cups of the tomato sauce, the 
remaining polenta, and the remaining tomato sauce. Sprinkle the mozzarella 
and Parmesan cheeses on top. Bake until browned and a knife inserted in 
the center comes out hot, 50 to 65 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes before 
serving. —Earl Le Claire

P O L E N TA  &  R I S O T T O   183Keeping Herbs Fresh
A little time spent when you get home from the market can add 
days to the life span of your herbs. First, remove from the plastic 
and shake off any excess water. Remove wire twists and wilted or 
slimy leaves. Dampen a length of paper towels, wring out well, 
and loosely wrap the herbs. Put the wrapped herbs in a plastic 
bag, press out any air, and close tightly. Try to store herbs in a 
warmer part of the fridge, as very cold temperatures can 
blacken them. Most fresh herbs will last up to a week.gorgonzola polenta

 2  Tbs. unsalted butter
 1  cup crumbled Gorgonzola
 1  tsp. chopped fresh thyme, or

tangy taste of Gorgonzola, this

companiment to roast chicken 
or pork.

3. Meanwhile, combine the polenta with the milk and salt. Slowly add the 
polenta mixture to the boiling chicken stock, stirring constantly. When the 
polenta begins to thicken, reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stir ring, 
until the polenta is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 
10 minutes. Stir in the butter until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat 
and stir in the Gorgonzola, thyme, and walnuts. —Earl Le Claire

 1/4   cup plus 1 Tbs. brown sugar
 1/2  cup honey
 41/2  cups milk
 3   Tbs. unsalted butter
 3/4   tsp. ground cinnamon
 1/4   tsp. ground nutmeg
 2 / 3   cup coarse-ground polenta
 2   eggs, lightly beaten
 2  tsp. sugar
 1 / 3   cup toasted hazelnuts, 
choppedA whole chopped orange, peel included, lends a wonderful flavor to the pud-
ding, and any trace of bitterness is cooked away.
1. Heat the oven to 325°F . In a food processor, combine the chopped orange 
and 1 Tbs. of the brown sugar. Pulse several times to mince the orange.
2. In a large saucepan, combine the orange mixture, the remaining 1/4 cup

combined. Let the mixture return to a boil. 
4. Slowly add the polenta, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to medium low 
and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove 
from the heat and whisk in the eggs until smooth. Pour the mixture into an 
8-inch-square baking dish. Sprinkle with sugar and dot with the remaining  
1 Tbs. butter.
5. Set the baking dish in a water bath. Bake until a knife inserted in the center 
comes out clean, 70 to 80 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, 
topped with the chopped hazelnuts. —Earl Le Claire
