Set aside the pieces of cake you take out. Fill each hole with a spoonful of the marshmallow and top with a piece of the saved cake. Use an offset spatula or knife to spread the cupcake tops with the ganache, covering them fully.",
            "Make a cornet out of parchment paper. A cornet is a small parchment paper cone that you fill with melted chocolate, caramel, or piping icing that you use to write on cakes and cookies. To make a cornet, fold a piece of parchment paper on the diagonal and cut through the fold with a small paring knife so you have two triangles. Position one of the triangles so the longest edge is facing away from you on an angle from lower left to upper right, the shortest edge is on the right, and the middle-length edge is facing down (toward you). Now eyeball the mid-length edge to find the halfway point. Place your left hand at this point and hold it down with your forefinger and thumb. Bend down the top corner, then twist it under so that the point is approximately at the midpoint of the shortest edge and poking out about an inch. You will see the beginning of a cone forming. Slowly roll the parchment down with your right hand while anchoring the opposite tip with your left hand. After you've rolled the whole triangle into a cone, tuck the extended point of the open top inward to hold everything in place.",
            "Fill the cornet halfway with the melted chocolate (don't overfill or you will end up with a mess) and roll the top of the cornet closed like a tube of toothpaste, making sure to roll the cornet with the seam on the bottom. Snip the point with scissors or cut it off with a small paring knife to make a tiny opening for the filling to come out.",
            "Draw a decorative swirl across each of the cupcakes. Serve immediately or within a few hours of filling.",

Add 1 cup water and cook the tomato, onion and berbere mixture until it reduces and begins to stick to the pan, about 10 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pot to bring up the stuck tomatoes and onions. Add another 1 cup water and allow the mixture to reduce again for another 10 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the pot. Add 1 cup water more, reduce again for 10 minutes then scrape the bottom of the pot (Adding and reducing 3 times will give your lentils a rich and layered flavor.) Be sure not to step away from the pot during this process. As Azla says, \"Misir wot has jealous tendencies and wants your full, undivided attention from start to finish.\"",

Finish with the ground nutmeg and sea salt to taste. Serve with injera or your favorite whole grain."

            "This is a fantastic, reliable, everyday pizza dough, which can also be used to make bread. It's best made with Italian Tipo \"00\" flour, which is finer ground than normal flour, and it will give your dough an incredible super-smooth texture. Look for it in Italian markets and good supermarkets. If using white bread flour instead, make sure it's a strong one that's high in gluten, as this will transform into a lovely, elastic dough, which is what you want. Mix in some semolina flour for a bit of color and flavor if you like.",
            "Sift the flours and salt onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a large measuring cup, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into the water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. Keep mixing, drawing larger amounts of flour in, and when it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean, flour-dusted hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough.",
            "Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and flour the top of it. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for about 1 hour until the dough has doubled in size.",
            "Now remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out with your hands - this is called punching down the dough. You can either use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in plastic wrap, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straightaway, divide the dough up into as many little balls as you want to make pizzas - this amount of dough is enough to make about six to eight medium pizzas.",
            "Timing-wise, it's a good idea to roll the pizzas out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Don't roll them out and leave them hanging around for a few hours, though - if you are working in advance like this it's better to leave your dough, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator. However, if you want to get them rolled out so there's 1 less thing to do when your guests are round, simply roll the dough out into rough circles, about 1\/4-inch thick, and place them on slightly larger pieces of olive-oil-rubbed and flour-dusted aluminum foil. You can then stack the pizzas, cover them with plastic wrap, and pop them into the refrigerator.",

Gently remove pears from liquid and allow to come to room temperature. Meanwhile, reduce liquid by about half over a medium-high flame for 15 minutes, until liquid is thicker and slightly syrupy. Remove from flame and let liquid come to room temperature. Drizzle each pear with 2 tablespoons syrup and serve."

Swirl your hand through the water and the rice; the water will go cloudy. That's all the starch that we're trying to remove in order to have individual grains of rice, not the sticky kind that's popular in Chinese and Japanese cuisine. (According to traditional Indian wisdom, this also makes the rice easier to digest because so much of the starch has been removed). Once you've swirled your hand around for a minute or so, pour off the water, taking care not to lose any rice. Repeat this washing process until the water runs clear. Usually, this takes 3 or 4 changes of water.",

Mix on medium speed while slowly adding the remaining water until well mixed and a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with a little flour if it gets too wet.",
            "On a floured surface, knead the dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in the bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for at least 1 hour.",
            "Make the dumpling wrappers: Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out the dough to form a long 'noodle', 1-inch in diameter. Cut 1\/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter.",
            "Make the vegetarian filling: Heat the oil in a wok or large saute pan over medium-high heat, then saute the onions and season with a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon white pepper. Add the ginger and mushrooms and saute 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cabbage, carrots and chives and season to taste. When the mixture is soft, place in a colander to drain. Add the cilantro and sesame oil when mixture is cooled. Check for seasoning.",
            "Make the dumplings: Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Lightly brush the top half edge with water and fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape. Starting on one end fold\/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold\/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 7 to 10 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up.",
            "Cook the dumplings: In a nonstick saute pan coated well with 1 tablespoon oil, place the pot stickers flat side down, turn the heat to medium-high and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready, add 1\/4 inch of water to the bottom of the pan and cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The water will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more water may be needed. (Ideally, you add about 1\/4 inch layer of liquid, depending on the size of the pan.) The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the water will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again. You can listen to the point no water is left, that is when you can take the lid off.",

            "When making Ballymaloe brown yeast bread, remember that yeast is a living organism. In order to grow, it requires warmth, moisture and nourishment. The yeast feeds on the sugar and produces bubbles of carbon dioxide which causes the bread to rise. Heat of over 122 degrees F\/50 degrees C will kill yeast. Have the ingredients and equipment at blood heat. White or brown sugar, honey golden syrup, treacle or molasses may be used. Each will give a slightly different flavour to the bread. At Ballymaloe we use treacle. The dough rises more rapidly with 1 ounce (25 grams) yeast than with 3\/4 ounce (20 grams) yeast.",
            "We use a stone ground wholemeal. Different flours produce breads of different textures and flavour. The amount of natural moisture in the flour varies according to atmospheric conditions. The quantity of water should be altered accordingly. The dough should be just too wet to knead - in fact it does not require kneading. The main ingredients - wholemeal flour, treacle and yeast are highly nutritious.",
            "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F\/230 degrees C\/gas mark 8.",
            "Mix the flour with the salt. In a small bowl or mixing cup, mix the treacle with 15 fluid ounces\/ scant 2 cups (425 milliliters) water and crumble in the yeast.",
            "Sit the bowl for a few minutes in a warm place to allow the yeast to start to work. Grease a 5 by 8-inch (13 by 20 centimeters) loaf tin with sunflower oil. Meanwhile, check to see if the yeast is rising. After about 4 or 5 minutes it will have a creamy and slightly frothy appearance on top.",
            "When ready, stir and pour it, with all the remaining 10 fluid ounces\/1 1\/4 cups (275 milliliters) water into the flour to make a loose, wet dough. The mixture should be too wet to knead. Put the mixture into the greased tin. Sprinkle the top of the loaves with sesame seeds, if you like. Put the tin in a warm place somewhere close to the cooker or near a radiator perhaps. Cover the tins with a tea towel to prevent a skin from forming. Just as the bread comes to the top of the tin, remove the tea towel and pop the loaves in the oven for 20 minutes, then turn the oven down to 400 degrees F\/200 degrees C\/gas mark 6 for another 40 to 50 minutes, or until it looks nicely browned and sound hollow when tapped. The bread will rise a little further in the oven. This is called \"oven spring\". If, however, the bread rises to the top of the tin before it goes into the oven it will continue to rise and flow over the edges.",
            "We usually remove the loaves from the tins about 10 minutes before the end of cooking and put them back into the oven to crisp all round, but if you like a softer crust there's no need to do this."

            "Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add the baking soda and remaining 3 teaspoons barley malt. Working with 3 or 4 bagels at a time so as not to crowd the pot, boil them for 1 minute on each side (use a timer for this). With a slotted spoon or spatula, lift them out of the water, allowing excess water to drip off, and then transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. (If making 16 bagels, you will likely need to bake a third pan of bagels, which you can do after the first 2 pans come out of the oven.)",
            "With a serrated knife, make 3 cuts in a triangular shape on top of the bagels and dust them lightly with flour. Bake the bagels for 10 minutes, then switch racks, rotate the baking sheets 180 degrees and bake until golden brown, 5 to 8 more minutes. Let cool slightly.",
            "If not eating right away, cool the bagels fully, then transfer to plastic bags and freeze (slice them before freezing if you'd like, so you can put them directly from the freezer into the toaster). Reheat in the toaster."
