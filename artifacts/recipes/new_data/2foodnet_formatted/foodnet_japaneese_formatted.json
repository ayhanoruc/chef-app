Once the beef is coated, drag and gather the beef to one corner of the pot.

            "Traditionally, you would crack an egg into an individual small serving bowl, scramble and use the egg as a dip for each bite of sukiyaki. Alternatively, you can crack the eggs into the sukiyaki as it simmers to gently poach them after adding the water."

A rice cooker is the best way to get perfect sticky-firm rice, but if you don't have one, just use a saucepan. Fold in the vinegar. Combine the vinegar, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Transfer the cooked rice to a large wooden bowl (traditionally, a wooden tub). Drizzle a quarter of the vinegar mixture over a wooden spoon or spatula onto the rice. Fold the rice gently with the spoon to cool it and break up any clumps; be careful not to smash the grains. Fold in the remaining vinegar mixture and let the rice sit 5 minutes. Spread the rice.",

Press the rice to spread it evenly up to the edges of the nori, moistening your fingers as you go. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.",
            "Prepare the vegetables. Peel the cucumber and slice into matchsticks. (Morimoto cuts the entire cucumber into a paper-thin sheet, then quickly slices it into strips-but he's had some practice.) Thinly slice the avocado, tomato and red onion; peel the tough ends of the asparagus. Add the filling. Carefully flip over the nori so it's rice-side down on the mat with the short end facing you. Spread a bit of wasabi paste in a line about one-third of the way up the nori-it's spicy, so use it sparingly. Arrange a few pieces each of lettuce, cucumber, avocado, tomato and onion in a tight pile in the lower third of the sheet. It's OK if the vegetables hang over the edges of the nori. Roll the sushi. Roll the sushi away from you with your hands, tucking in the vegetables as you go. Remove the mat from under the roll and place it on top. Press the roll into a compact rectangular log, using the mat to help you. Slice the roll. Cut the sushi roll into 4 to 6 pieces. Repeat with the remaining nori, rice and vegetables. Serve with pickled ginger and more wasabi. Photography by Rick Lew"

Fold the top edge of the oval over to the center, then repeat with the bottom edge. Tightly roll the right edge of the dough until you form a log. Gently transfer the log to the prepared pan seam-side down, so one of the smooth sides touches one end of the pan. Repeat with the remaining ball of dough, setting it in the pan so one of the smooth sides touches the other end of the pan. Cover with the kitchen towel, set in a warm place and let rise until doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.",

Carefully remove the bread from the pan and set on a wire rack on its side for at least 1 hour before slicing. (If you cut it when the bread is warm, it will compress and lose its fluffy texture.)"

Reduce the heat to low and cook until all the liquid is absorbed by the rice, about 12 to 13 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the rice stand, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes. Using a flat wooden spoon or rice paddle, fluff the rice with a cutting motion. Stretch a towel under the lid and cover tightly to keep warm until ready to use.",

Make an indentation in the rice and tuck in one of the fillings: a teaspoon of soaked bonito flakes, a few flakes of salmon, or a few pieces of pickled plum. Close the rice over the filling and mold it into a triangular shape. Mold the rice firmly, pressing just hard enough to hold it together. Set the rice triangle down on one of its sides and cover the top peak with a strip of nori, shiny side out, like a roof. You can also make cylindrical shapes and wrap the nori around the middle. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the rice shapes. These are great lunch treats."

Place kombu, cleaned anchovies, and shiitakes in a large pot. Add the cold water. Cover pot and let soak at room temperature, 10-12 hours. (Alternatively, store in the refrigerator for up to a week before making dashi.)",
            "Simmer: Place pot over high heat, uncovered, until the surface of the water begins to ripple, but do not allow it to come to a boil. Lower heat to a very low flame: the ideal temperature is a few degrees below a light boil (55 degrees C or 131 degrees F). Taste every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture; the dashi will usually be finished in around 80-90 minutes. You are looking for a sea essence, with a tiny hint of sweetness and a very silky texture (similar to Evian water), with no real seasoning. Be vigilant, as dashi will turn bitter if cooked too long. Strain and refrigerate in a covered container for up to 1 day. After 24 hours, the dashi will begin to lose some of its characteristic flavor, and will go slightly flat. Cooked and cooled dashi can be frozen for up to 2 weeks."

Turn the vegetables at intervals to ensure that both sides are cooked equally and then fish them out with a slotted spoon, shaking off any excess oil. Place them on kitchen paper towels and eat as soon as possible. The reason that I keep going on about eating them so quickly is because as your hot cooked vegetables cool down inside the batter they begin to steam, making them less crisp as time goes on.

            "For the pancake dough: Combine the flour, water, sesame oil and 1\/2 teaspoon salt in a mixing bowl and mix with a rubber spatula until a soft and sticky dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic but still sticky. Wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.",
            "While the dough rests, prepare the Pork Belly (recipe follows) and Chili Vinegar (recipe follows).",
            "When the dough has rested, divide into quarters. Place one piece on a lightly floured surface and keep the rest covered with plastic. Roll out until you have a paper-thin 10- to 12-inch circle. Allowing the dough to stick a little to the surface while you roll helps to stretch the dough as thin as possible. This part is a little tricky since the dough is soft and sticky but be patient and don\u2019t use too much flour. Repeat with the rest of the dough.",
            "To assemble: Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon of oil, swirl it around to coat, and allow to get hot and shimmery. Gently lay the pancake in the oil. Crack an egg directly onto the pancake. Use the back of a spoon to gently break the yolk, very gently scramble, and then spread it all over the pancake. Sprinkle on a handful of scallions and a handful of the pork belly. Season with salt and black pepper and then press down slightly so the scallions and pork belly stick to the egg. Continue to cook until the egg is mostly set and the underside of the pancake has golden brown spots. Using a spatula, carefully flip and cook, egg side down, for about 30 seconds, or until the egg is completely set and has some brown spots. The pork will also render out some fat and get sizzly. Flip the pancake back over and allow the pancake to get nice and crisp, 30 seconds. Slide the pancake onto a cutting board. Squeeze some mayonnaise on top and a drizzle of sambal, if using. Roll up and slice in half. Repeat to make 3 more pancakes. Serve with Chili Vinegar (see recipe below) for dipping.",
            "*Alternatively, this recipe can be made with 16 slices of roughly chopped, cooked, thick-cut bacon by eliminating the braise in the pressure cooker. Simply cook the bacon to desired doneness and skip to the step of applying the bacon onto the egg as it cooks in the pan on the pancake. To serve, drizzle with hoisin sauce, mayo and sambal. Serve with the chili vinegar for dipping.",
            "Sprinkle the pork belly on all sides with black pepper.",
            "Into the insert-pot of a pressure cooker add the soy sauce, vinegar, water and hoisin sauce and whisk to combine. Place the pork belly in the pot, skin side up (it should be mostly submerged but if the skin peeks out a little it\u2019s fine). Add the ginger, garlic and chili pepper, if using. Seal with the lid, bring to HIGH pressure and cook for 30 minutes. Carefully release the pressure, away from your face, allowing all the steam to dissipate before opening the lid. Using tongs, remove the belly to a cooling rack set over a sheet pan to both cool slightly and drain of excess braising liquid. Alternatively, the pork belly can be braised in a Dutch oven at 350 degrees F for about 2 hours, covered. Discard the braising liquid. Roughly chop the pork belly into bite-size pieces.",
            "Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add the chopped pork to the pan and fry for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until crispy. Set aside.",

Drain the excess water from the noodles and distribute the noodles between 4 bowls.",
