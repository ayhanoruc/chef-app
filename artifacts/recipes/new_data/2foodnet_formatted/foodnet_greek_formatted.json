Discard the bay leaf, cinnamon stick and cloves.",

Pour the cashew bechamel on top and bake until the bechamel starts to bubble and turn golden brown in spots, about 25 minutes. Let rest for 20 minutes, then slice into squares to serve."

Brush the sheet with melted butter, then sprinkle evenly with some oregano and chives. Repeat with 2 more sheets of phyllo, stacking on top of each other. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the sheets lengthwise into thirds to form 2 1\/2-inch strips. Do this with all the sheets of dough.",

Brush the top with butter and dust with Parmesan, place on prepared baking sheet, and cover while preparing the remaining pastries. Repeat until all the filling and phyllo strips are used up. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until the triangles are crisp and golden. Serve hot, warm or cold."

Cut each markouk in half. Repeat with the remaining two markouk breads so there are 6 pieces. Make an egg wash by whisking two tablespoons of water, a pinch of salt and the egg yolk. Lightly brush a piece of markouk halfway up. Place a kebab at one end and tightly roll it lengthwise so the markout is tightly wrapped around the beef. Trim the edges and brush the seam with more egg wash so it\u2019s sealed. Place it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the other kebabs. Lightly brush the tops with egg wash, sprinkle with nigella seeds and bake for 12 minutes until crispy on the outside and firm to the touch.

Place the garlic into the lemon juice along with a pinch of salt. Chop the cucumber, scallions, and parsley and add them to the garlic. Finish by mixing in the yogurt, dried mint, and olive oil. Season with salt and set aside.",
