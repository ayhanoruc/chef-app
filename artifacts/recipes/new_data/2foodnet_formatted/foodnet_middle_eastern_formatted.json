Cut each markouk in half. Repeat with the remaining two markouk breads so there are 6 pieces. Make an egg wash by whisking two tablespoons of water, a pinch of salt and the egg yolk. Lightly brush a piece of markouk halfway up. Place a kebab at one end and tightly roll it lengthwise so the markout is tightly wrapped around the beef. Trim the edges and brush the seam with more egg wash so it\u2019s sealed. Place it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the other kebabs. Lightly brush the tops with egg wash, sprinkle with nigella seeds and bake for 12 minutes until crispy on the outside and firm to the touch. (Note: If Markouk bread gets too dry while wrapping the kebabs, just wet it lightly with water.)",

Place the garlic into the lemon juice along with a pinch of salt. Chop the cucumber, scallions, and parsley and add them to the garlic. Finish by mixing in the yogurt, dried mint, and olive oil. Season with salt and set aside.",

Repeat with all the wings. Fry for 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spider strainer to make sure the wings don\u2019t stick together or to the bottom of the pot.

Meanwhile, reheat the oil to just above 350 degrees F (temperature will drop slightly when the chicken is added). Use the slotted spoon to remove and discard stray bits of batter from the oil. (Note: The wings can be made to this point up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated; bring it back to room temperature before the second fry.)",

Serve immediately. (Note: Frying oil can be reused several more times for frying chicken. Cool the oil completely, then pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean jar.

Add the remaining teaspoon baking soda and water to cover by about 3 inches over the chickpeas. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, skimming off and discarding any foam that rises to the surface. Cook the chickpeas until tender but still hold their shape, about 30 minutes. Remove 1 cup of chickpeas from the pot with a slotted spoon. Drain well and reserve on a paper towel-lined plate to dry. Continue cooking the remaining chickpeas until they are mostly intact and soft and creamy (not crumbly) when pressed between a thumb and forefinger, about 10 minutes more. If the liquid boils off too much while cooking, add more water to cover and continue to cook.",
            "Meanwhile, make the parsley oil. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the parsley leaves and cook 10 seconds, then drain. Immediately run the parsley under very cold water to cool it completely, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Squeeze out the excess liquid and then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to dry.",
            "When the chickpeas are done cooking, strain them and discard the liquid. Let the chickpeas sit in the strainer to drain and dry out for 5 minutes. Put the chickpeas in the bowl of a food processor along with the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and 1 3\/4 teaspoons salt and process until the mixture is a paste, scraping down the bowl as necessary. With the motor running, slowly pour in 1\/4 cup of the ice water and continue to process, adding more water by the tablespoon as necessary, until the mixture is smooth and light, about 5 minutes. The hummus should be slightly loose because it will firm up as it sits.",
            "Transfer the hummus to a shallow bowl and cover by lightly pressing plastic wrap directly onto the surface; set aside until ready to serve. (The hummus can also be made a day ahead and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.)",
            "Put the cooked parsley leaves in a blender along with 1\/2 cup olive oil and puree until the parsley is fine and the oil green, about 5 minutes. Transfer the parsley oil to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface. Parsley oil can be used right away, or held at room temperature up to 6 hours",
            "Just before serving, fry the chickpeas. Heat the remaining 1\/2 cup oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat for about 2 minutes. Pat the reserved chickpeas dry with a clean towel and carefully add them to the skillet. (The oil will bubble up for a few seconds.) Fry, shaking the pan occasionally, until browned and crisp, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer the chickpeas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Immediately sprinkle with the lemon zest, cayenne, cumin and some salt; toss to coat.",
            "Remove the plastic wrap from the reserved hummus. Make a shallow circular indentation with the back of a spoon in the center of the hummus. Mound the fried chickpeas in the center of the hummus. Drizzle with the parsley oil, spooning most of it around the edges of the hummus."

Stir 100 times (one minute) in the same direction to activate the gluten in the flour. Let this sponge rest for at least 10 minutes or as long as 2 hours.",

When the dough is too stiff to stir, turn it out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic. Return the dough to a lightly oiled bread bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until at least double in size, approximately 1 1\/2 hours. Gently punch down. Dough can be made ahead to this point and then stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 5 days or less.",
            "If at this time you want to save the dough in the refrigerator for baking later, simply wrap it in a plastic bag that is at least three times the size of the dough, pull the bag together, and secure it just at the opening of the bag. This will give the dough a chance to expand when it is in the refrigerator (which it will do). From day to day, simply cut off the amount of dough you need and keep the rest in the refrigerator, for up to one week. The dough will smell slightly fermented after a few days, but this simply improves the taste of the bread. Dough should be brought to room temperature before baking.",
            "This amount of dough will make approximately 16 pitas if rolled out into circles approximately 8 to 9 inches in diameter and less than 1\/4-inch thick. You can also of course make smaller breads. Size and shape all depend on you, but for breads of this dimension the following baking tips apply:",
            "Place unglazed quarry tiles, or a large baking stone or two baking sheets, on a rack in the bottom third of your oven, leaving a one inch gap all around to allow air to circulate. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Divide dough in half, then set half aside, covered, while you work with the rest. Divide dough into eight equal pieces and flatten each piece with lightly floured hands. Roll out each piece to a circle 8 to 9 inches in diameter. You may wish to roll out all eight before starting to bake. Cover rolled out breads, but do not stack.",
            "Bake 2 at a time (or more if your oven is larger) directly on quarry tiles or baking sheets. Bake each bread for 3 or 4 minutes, until the bread has gone into a full \"balloon\" or until it is starting to turn lightly golden, whichever happens first. If there are seams or dry bits of dough - or for a variety of other reasons - your bread may not go into a full \"balloon\". Don't worry, it will still taste great. The more you bake pitas the more you will become familiar with all the little tricks and pitfalls, and your breads will more consistently \"balloon.\" But even then, if you're like us, it won't always \"balloon\" fully and you won't mind because the taste will still be wonderful. When baked, remove, place on a rack for about five minutes to let cool slightly, then wrap breads in a large kitchen towel (this will keep the breads soft). When first half of the dough has been rolled out and baked, repeat for rest of dough, or store in refrigerator for later use, as described above. You can also divide the dough into more, smaller pieces if you wish, to give you smaller breads."

Now stretch the dough gently into a long oval strip by draping it over both hands and pulling them apart gently. The dough should stretch and give, and after several tries will extend to make a long oval about 12 inches long with attractive stretch marks along it from the stretched indentations (hence, the name \"snowshoe bread\").",

You will soon develop a rhythm so that you can bake two breads side by side across your oven, one going in when the other is half done. When done, breads will have golden patches on top and a crusty browned bottom surface. To keep breads warm and soft, wrap them in a cotton cloth five minutes after they come out of the oven.",
