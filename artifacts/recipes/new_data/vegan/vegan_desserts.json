A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but won't make your cookies taste salty.\n\u00b7 Coconut oil: Since this recipe is vegan, it calls for coconut oil instead of butter or shortening.\n\u00b7 Molasses: Use molasses to deepen the spicy flavor of these vegan gingerbread cookies.\n\u00b7 Sugar: White sugar sweetens things up a bit, balancing out the deeper flavors from the molasses and spices.\n\u00b7 Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract adds complexity and enhances the flavor.",

Follow the recipe when you're ready to eat them, but add a few minutes to the bake time to account for the frozen temperature.",
