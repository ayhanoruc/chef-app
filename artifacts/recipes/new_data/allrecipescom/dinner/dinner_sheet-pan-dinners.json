            "\"Adding chickpeas to root vegetables on a sheet pan makes for an easy dinner! Make sure to cut all the vegetables the same size or they won't cook properly!\" recipe creator Kim says. This recipe calls for onion powder, fennel, garlic powder, and sage, but feel free to sub in whichever spice blend you prefer.",
            "This oven-baked dinner features chicken thighs, baby potatoes, Kalamata olives, peppers, Mediterranean herbs, a sprinkle of feta cheese, and a hearty squeeze of lemon juice. For a lighter variation on the original, use skinless thighs.",
            "This easy dish delivers massive flavor with a handful of ingredients and in only a few short steps. Serving it over a scoop of quinoa or farro makes for an ideal plant-based winter entree.",
            "This bright chicken and veggie dish is a complete meal made on one baking sheet. \"Clementine and sage are the main flavor components in this dish, but can be subbed for other citrus, herbs, or spices to change it up,\" says Sarabeth Elyse, the recipe submitter.",
            "This clever sheet pan recipe reimagines chili, which generally resembles a soup or a stew. Here, in sheet pan form, it features well-seasoned ground turkey with plenty of vegetables and toasty cornbread \"dumplings.\" It's far speedier (and healthier) than a classic chili, but it still packs the chili flavors that you know and love.",
            "\"Spice up chicken dinners with a touch of harissa. The North African red pepper sauce adds depth and kick to this one-pan meal perfect for weeknights,\" says Juliana Hale of this vibrant sheet pan feast, which includes carrots and cauliflower as nutritious sides for the spicy baked chicken.",
            "Lately, cauliflower has been one of the hottest recipe ingredients going, and this simple recipe lets the cauliflower shine while introducing flavors of lemon and curry powder.",
            "Cheese can certainly be part of a healthy diet, and this recipe uses a little grated Parmesan to great effect by combining it with Panko for a light layer of breading that makes this oven-baked chicken crispy. The recommended sauce includes mayo and ketchup, but if you'd prefer a plant-based alternative, try marinara or salsa.",
            "This sheet pan spin on Korean bulgogi delivers massive flavor, thanks to a soy-ginger-sesame marinade for the steak and the inclusion of sweet snap peas and green onions. \"A super hot oven delivers a delicious way to cook up a weeknight meal. For best results, you'll want some meat with marbling. Serve over rice,\" says recipe creator FrackFamily5.",
            "Salmon has a richness that makes it feel more winter-appropriate than many other fish, and this recipe features a sweet-and-spicy marinade and roasted red and yellow peppers. \"An easy recipe for a quick dinner for weeknights with salmon, bell peppers, parsley, and lemon that is ready in about 30 minutes. I usually serve it with rice,\" says recipe writer barbara.",
            "If you're craving a healthier (and homemade) twist on classic Chinese takeout, try this crowd pleasing recipe by Bibi, who tells us: \"In order to make it sheet pan friendly, the chicken is not breaded or fried. Add as much of the delicious sauce as you like, and if there is any left over, store the sauce in the fridge in a sealed container for up to one week. It's also a great dipping sauce for Asian-style appetizers. Serve over hot steamed rice.\"",

            "Recipe creator SlimCookins calls this flatbread topped with butternut squash, red onion, and herbs \"a colorful and flavorful twist\" on a typical veggie pizza. By way of advice, SlimCookins also says that \"dusting the baking sheet with cornmeal prevents dough from sticking and gives it a lil' crunch.\"",
            "Bowl-style dining is a massive hit for excellent reason: It makes eating your healthy vegetables, proteins, and grains very simple and straightforward. This bowl features healthy plant-based ingredients like cannellini beans, zucchini, arugula, and grape tomatoes, plus plenty of herbs and some toasted pine nuts for crunch.",
            "Meatloaf isn't often associated with healthy eating, but this recipe replaces the standard ground beef with ground turkey, which has less saturated fat, but still gives the meatloaf delicious flavor and texture."

These top-rated sheet-pan recipes get the job done with chicken in the starring role, ably accompanied by the kind of tasty vegetables that chicken loves best: potatoes, broccoli, peppers, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, green beans, and more.",
            "This easy sheet-pan dinner features herb-roasted vegetables and boneless, skinless chicken breasts. \"Baked EXTRA CRISPY Parmesan chicken and veggies\u2014dinner made on one pan and packed with flavor!\" says chpmnk42.",
            "Browned Italian sausage and chicken thighs with sweet peppers, red onions, and Yukon Gold potatoes are doused in olive oil and tossed with dried herbs before hitting a very hot oven. Chef John says, \"You'll need a large, heavy-duty roasting pan (or a couple of smaller ones) and a very hot oven for this delicious dish. The long oven time makes everything beautifully caramelized and the chicken fork tender.\" Meanwhile, ccok4fun raves about it: \"This recipe is amazing! I highly recommend watching the video. Next time I'll use more veggies & potatoes because they are just delicious!\"",
            "Chicken breasts are baked on a bed of fresh carrots, bell peppers, and celery. \"Easy prep, great weeknight meal,\" says says cindaZ. \"Good combo of flavors served the vegs over white rice.\"",
            "\"Rosemary, garlic, and oregano create a mouth-watering aroma, says SANDY WITEK. \"The potatoes are crispy like french fries, just serve with ketchup. Kids just love this! This one-pan meal is in the oven in 15 minutes. Note: If using dried herbs in place of fresh, use 1/3 the amount.\"",
            "Here's a super-easy baked chicken main dish with potatoes, broccoli, and Italian dressing mix. So simple! \"Loved this! Per other reviews, I did add a little more butter and the potatoes and chicken were nicely cooked and moist by the end, and the broccoli was just perfect,\" says reviewer Kelsey Macomber.",
            "A sheet pan full of fajitas combines chicken, peppers, onions, and a mix of seasonings. \"I thought the seasoning level was perfect and it was really easy to throw everything together on a pan,\" says Rachel Lehman.",

Want to serve your family a well rounded, nutritious meal but running short on time? This easy sheet pan dinner is the answer.\"",

            "\"Spice up chicken dinners with a touch of harissa, the North African red pepper sauce,\" says the Betty Soup. \"It adds depth and kick to this one-pan meal of chicken thighs, carrots, and cauliflower. Perfect for weeknights.\"",
            "This one-pan Greek chicken is roasted on a sheet pan with potatoes and green beans. \"Probably the best tasting chicken I ever made,\" says Marcelle Broussard. \"The chicken makes a lot of drippings because you leave skin on. I did take kitchen scissors and cut off all visible fat. We loved it, and it is even good heated up next day or cold.\"",
            "\"Prepared pesto is all you need to turn plain chicken and potatoes into a flavorful dinner,\" says France C. \"Serve with a side salad for a complete meal.\"",
            "\"Inspired by the flavors of our favorite Asian takeout, here's a recipe that uses canned pineapple tidbits, with the usual veggies,\" says Bibi. \"In order to make it sheet-pan friendly, the chicken is not breaded or fried. Add as much of the delicious sauce as you like, and if there is any left, store the sauce in the fridge in a sealed container, up to one week. It's also a great dipping sauce for Asian-style appetizers. Serve over hot steamed rice.\"",
            "\"This complete Greek-inspired chicken dinner is made simply and easily on one pan with the chicken, veggies, and potatoes cooking together,\" says fabeveryday. \"Perfect for busy weeknights!\"",
            "Chicken thighs and sausage mix it up with Brussels sprouts and seasonings in this simple and satisfying meal. \"An easy sheet pan dinner, full of flavor that can be easily customized to your tastes,\" says Jewelzee. \"The secret is roasting at a high temperature, allowing the water to steam out, leaving all that concentrated, yummy flavor.\"",
