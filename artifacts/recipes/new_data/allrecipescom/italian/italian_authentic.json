            "There are basically three ways you can do Italian sausage and spaghetti. Two of those ways are very popular and perfectly acceptable. This recipe features the much lesser known third method, which I feel is vastly superior in both taste and texture (although it requires doing something I've been training you for years not to do, and that's overcooking meat).",
            "The secret to this simple method is simmering the pieces of sausage way longer than necessary to cook them. A two-inch section of Italian sausage only needs to braise in tomato sauce for about ten minutes to be \"cooked through,\" so it might seem a little crazy to simmer it for 90 minutes, but if you can get past that seemingly insane instruction, you'll be treated to one of the best pasta sauces of your life.",
            "Thanks to the long, slow braising, the flavors in the sausage permeate the sauce. This will turn even the most unremarkable ragu into something memorable. In addition, the texture of the sausage transforms into something completely different and, in my opinion, completely wonderful. The only catch (yes, there's always a catch) is that you have to wait an hour and a half to eat. Hey, you can spend the time making a nice salad, and maybe some garlic bread. But no matter what you serve with this Italian sausage spaghetti, I really hope you make it soon. Enjoy!",

            "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Transfer sausage links into the hot pot. Cover with a lid and cook until beautifully browned and just barely cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. You can increase the heat a little if you like, but make sure the oil does not smoke. Turn off the heat and remove sausages to a plate to cool completely.",
            "While the sausages are cooling, add wine to the same pot over medium-high heat. As it comes up to a simmer, stir the caramelized bits on the bottom of a pan with a spoon or spatula. Simmer until it reduces by about half, 1 to 2 minutes.",
            "Add marinara sauce. Pour water into the jar of pasta sauce, seal, and shake to rinse out the jar. Pour that liquid into the pot and return to a simmer. Reduce heat to low.",
            "Slice each fully cooled sausage into 4 pieces. Transfer sausage and any accumulated juices into the simmering sauce. Stir and increase heat to just between low and medium-low. Cook at a gentle, steady simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Taste and adjust seasonings. Skim about 1\/2 of the fat from the surface, and continue to cook until reduced and thick, about 30 minutes longer.",
            "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until almost tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain spaghetti and transfer it directly into the pot of hot sauce. Mix until thoroughly combined. Cover with the lid and let sit for 1 minute so the pasta can absorb some of the sauce.",
            "Evenly divide pasta onto 4 plates and top each serving with 4 pieces sausage. Sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano and parsley.",
            "You can use spicy or mild sausage links. Just make sure the sausage you use has enough fat that you can see it through the casings.",
            "You can use 3 tablespoons water mixed with 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar, in place of the wine, but the wine really adds better flavor to the sauce.",
            "If the sauce is too thick, toss another splash of water in.",
            "I use a thick, #12 spaghetti, but any spaghetti or pasta will work, as long as you cook it in generously salted water."

Thaw at room temperature.",

You may need to experiment with the amount of batter and baking time depending on the iron. Bake for 20 to 45 seconds or until steam is no longer coming out of the iron. Carefully remove cookie from the iron and repeat with remaining batter.",

Then add 1\/4 cup cocoa powder sifted together in the flour-baking powder mixture with an extra 1\/4 teaspoon baking powder as well.

            "Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.",
            "You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:",
            "The best bread for bruschetta has a sturdy crust and is firm enough to hold the bruschetta topping. Choose a loaf of Italian bread, such as ciabatta, for a more traditional bruschetta. This recipe uses slices of French bread, like a baguette. Slice the bread on the diagonal at least \u00bc-inch thick or more to make an oval shape.",
            "You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below \u2014 but here are a few of our favorite tips for making the best bruschetta every time:",
            "\u00b7 Quality counts: The beauty of a simple recipe like bruschetta is that it showcases the flavor of the individual ingredients. For this recipe, you can really taste the difference when you use ripe tomatoes and fresh (not dried) basil; the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can afford, and hand-grated Parmesan cheese instead of pre-packaged grated cheese.\n\u00b7 Add flavor with garlic: As an alternative to adding minced raw garlic to the tomato mixture, cut a peeled clove of garlic in half lengthwise and lightly rub the cut side over the slightly roughened surface of the toasted bread to impart a hint of garlic flavor. Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way.\n\u00b7 Be patient: Make the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though \u2014 lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread. If you're going to top the bread first before serving, save that step until the last minute so the bread doesn't get soggy as it sits.",

            "While you can freeze asparagus risotto for up to three months, we don\u2019t recommend it. The texture will change during the freezing and thawing process, so it won\u2019t be quite as good as when it was freshly made.",

            "\u201cLoved this,\u201d says TO-Mum. \u201cCreamy texture. Lemon makes a nice addition. I pan-seared a couple of scallops and served them on the side.\u201d",
            "\u201cThis was fantastic and easy to make,\u201d raves Momma Clo. \u201cI used water and a little extra wine instead of the broth (didn't have any) and it was very good! Will surely make it again. Served with some lemon dill cod.\u201d",

            "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and celery; cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Stir in Arborio rice and garlic; cook and stir until rice is lightly toasted, about 5 more minutes.",
            "Stir in white wine and simmer until it has mostly evaporated, then stir in 1\/3 of the hot chicken broth; continue stirring until rice has absorbed liquid and turned creamy. Repeat this process twice more, stirring constantly. Stirring in the broth should take 15 to 20 minutes in all. When finished, rice should be tender yet firm to the bite. Stir in asparagus.",

They\u2019re usually recipes or food articles he thinks I may be interested in. In fact, sometimes he\u2019ll do something people almost never do these days: He\u2019ll actually walk to the post office and mail us the piece to read. Yes, just like before the Internet.",
