            "There are basically three ways you can do Italian sausage and spaghetti. Two of those ways are very popular and perfectly acceptable. This recipe features the much lesser known third method, which I feel is vastly superior in both taste and texture (although it requires doing something I've been training you for years not to do, and that's overcooking meat).",
            "The secret to this simple method is simmering the pieces of sausage way longer than necessary to cook them. A two-inch section of Italian sausage only needs to braise in tomato sauce for about ten minutes to be \"cooked through,\" so it might seem a little crazy to simmer it for 90 minutes, but if you can get past that seemingly insane instruction, you'll be treated to one of the best pasta sauces of your life.",
            "Thanks to the long, slow braising, the flavors in the sausage permeate the sauce. This will turn even the most unremarkable ragu into something memorable. In addition, the texture of the sausage transforms into something completely different and, in my opinion, completely wonderful. The only catch (yes, there's always a catch) is that you have to wait an hour and a half to eat. Hey, you can spend the time making a nice salad, and maybe some garlic bread. But no matter what you serve with this Italian sausage spaghetti, I really hope you make it soon. Enjoy!",

            "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Transfer sausage links into the hot pot. Cover with a lid and cook until beautifully browned and just barely cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. You can increase the heat a little if you like, but make sure the oil does not smoke. Turn off the heat and remove sausages to a plate to cool completely.",
            "While the sausages are cooling, add wine to the same pot over medium-high heat. As it comes up to a simmer, stir the caramelized bits on the bottom of a pan with a spoon or spatula. Simmer until it reduces by about half, 1 to 2 minutes.",
            "Add marinara sauce. Pour water into the jar of pasta sauce, seal, and shake to rinse out the jar. Pour that liquid into the pot and return to a simmer. Reduce heat to low.",
            "Slice each fully cooled sausage into 4 pieces. Transfer sausage and any accumulated juices into the simmering sauce. Stir and increase heat to just between low and medium-low. Cook at a gentle, steady simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Taste and adjust seasonings. Skim about 1/2 of the fat from the surface, and continue to cook until reduced and thick, about 30 minutes longer.",
            "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until almost tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain spaghetti and transfer it directly into the pot of hot sauce. Mix until thoroughly combined. Cover with the lid and let sit for 1 minute so the pasta can absorb some of the sauce.",
            "Evenly divide pasta onto 4 plates and top each serving with 4 pieces sausage. Sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano and parsley.",
            "You can use spicy or mild sausage links. Just make sure the sausage you use has enough fat that you can see it through the casings.",
            "You can use 3 tablespoons water mixed with 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar, in place of the wine, but the wine really adds better flavor to the sauce.",
            "If the sauce is too thick, toss another splash of water in.",
            "I use a thick, #12 spaghetti, but any spaghetti or pasta will work, as long as you cook it in generously salted water."

            "Italians know their cheese. But dare I say no Italian cheese has better proven this than burrata. This relatively young cheese was developed in the 20th century. The exterior resembles fresh mozzarella, but break into it with a fork, and you'll find a surprise inside: an ooey, gooey mixture of cream and small cheese curds. It's just begging to be scooped up with a slice of crunchy, Italian bread!",
            "Get to know this Italian cheese, and get top-rated recipes for putting it on display. Here's everything you need to know about burrata.",
            "Burrata is a soft, fresh Italian cheese made from cow's milk. Based on the outer appearance alone, this cheese could easily be mistaken for fresh mozzarella\u2014and that's because the outer shell is made of soft mozzarella.",
            "But break into it, and you'll be pleasantly surprised to find an oozing, soft interior made of small cheese curds and cream. In fact, the Italian word burro, translates to butter, giving you an idea of just how rich and creamy it is.",
            "This decadent cheese originated in southern Italy and dates back to the early 1900s (at least four centuries after the development of mozzarella). Ever since, burrata has been a key ingredient in Italian dishes such as pizza, pasta, and Caprese salads. But, in my opinion, there's no better way to eat burrata than on its own with a little olive oil and Italian bread.",
            "Burrata is essentially a shell of mozzarella wrapped around a lush mixture of cheese curds and cream all formed into one supple, malleable ball. But how does it go from mozzarella and cream to the ball of cheesy goodness we know it as today? It's a meticulous process perfected by Italian artisans, but here we'll break it down into layman's terms as best we can.",
            "Burrata starts like any cheese, with cultures and rennet, which are added to warm, fresh cow's milk. As the milk starts curdling, the whey separates and is drained off. Next, boiling water is poured over the curds, which are then stretched, essentially making mozzarella.",
            "But here's where burrata distinguishes itself from mozzarella: The stretched curd is used to create a pouch, that is then filled with a mixture of cream and fresh curds. The pouch is then sealed off to create burrata's signature, dumpling-like shape.",
            "We've established that burrata is rich, so it should come as no surprise that it is often described as \"buttery.\" Truthfully, the thing that's so beautiful about this fresh cheese is the supreme balance it achieves in both flavor and texture. Burrata has similar flavor notes as fresh mozzarella cheese, but with a more decadent, concentrated milky taste and a sweetness that's reminiscent of rich cream.",
            "Based on appearance alone, it's easy to confuse burrata with fresh mozzarella. But as we know, looks aren't everything. Mozzarella is an essential ingredient in burrata\u2014it is used to make the outer wrapping or \"shell.\" But unlike mozzarella, which is made from stretched curds all the way through, burrata's center is made from a mixture of fresh cream and curds.",
            "The two kinds of cheese are similar in flavor, but burrata has a looser, more rich texture, thanks to the cream. Burrata is also higher in fat than mozzarella, again, thanks to the cream. Both types of cheese are typically packaged in some type of liquid to retain moisture. While both kinds of cheese are rich in flavor and texture, burrata's creamy center makes it ideal for the occasional indulgence.",
            "Although both are soft, fresh Italian cheeses with similar sounding names, ricotta and burrata are not the same, nor are they commonly substituted for one another. Ricotta is made using the whey leftover from producing other cheeses and has a very mild, delicately sweet, and creamy flavor. It does not have the mozzarella-like pouch that is a signature of burrata, and because of its high moisture content, is easily spreadable. Fluffy ricotta cheese is typically sold in a lidded, plastic container\u2014often shelved next to cottage cheese in supermarkets\u2014and is a staple ingredient in a wide variety of dishes, such as lasagna and other types of pastas, cakes, and even cookies.",
            "The next best thing to burrata is, you guessed it, fresh mozzarella. Because the two cheeses bear a resemblance in both flavor and ingredients, they are going to make the best substitutes for one another in recipes. However, you won't get that same creamy, loose texture with mozzarella that you get with burrata.",
            "But if you're planning to melt the cheese, fresh mozzarella is the better (and more affordable) choice anyway. The appeal of burrata is its creamy center, which is lost when it is melted.",
            "To make the most of burrata, use it in dishes that can really show off its texture contrast. And always serve it at room temperature for best results. As we've already established, drizzling it with a little olive oil and scooping it up with crunchy, Italian bread is my favorite way to indulge in it.",
            "But you can also serve burrata overtop a salad, paired with fruit, or as a pizza topping (just be sure to place it on the pizza after baking, so you don't lose the texture). And of course, this Italian cheese is the perfect pairing for fresh tomatoes and basil.",
            "The decadent, creamy texture of burrata makes it a little difficult to preserve. Once cut into, burrata is best enjoyed immediately. This cheese isn't going to freeze well, because of its high moisture content. Refrigerate in its original packaging or in an airtight container filled with water for up to five days."

            "Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.",
            "You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:",
            "The best bread for bruschetta has a sturdy crust and is firm enough to hold the bruschetta topping. Choose a loaf of Italian bread, such as ciabatta, for a more traditional bruschetta. This recipe uses slices of French bread, like a baguette. Slice the bread on the diagonal at least \u00bc-inch thick or more to make an oval shape.",
            "You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below \u2014 but here are a few of our favorite tips for making the best bruschetta every time:",
            "\u00b7 Quality counts: The beauty of a simple recipe like bruschetta is that it showcases the flavor of the individual ingredients. For this recipe, you can really taste the difference when you use ripe tomatoes and fresh (not dried) basil; the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can afford, and hand-grated Parmesan cheese instead of pre-packaged grated cheese.\n\u00b7 Add flavor with garlic: As an alternative to adding minced raw garlic to the tomato mixture, cut a peeled clove of garlic in half lengthwise and lightly rub the cut side over the slightly roughened surface of the toasted bread to impart a hint of garlic flavor. Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way.\n\u00b7 Be patient: Make the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though \u2014 lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread. If you're going to top the bread first before serving, save that step until the last minute so the bread doesn't get soggy as it sits.",

            "A key ingredient in many classic Italian pasta dishes, guanciale might be the solution to unlocking a new level of flavor when it comes to your Italian cooking. The fatty cured meat can be challenging to find, but seeking it out is worth the effort. Keep reading to learn more about this Italian favorite.",
            "Guanciale is a pork product made from a pig's cheek. The name guanciale comes from the Italian word for cheek, guancia. Guanciale is super fatty and usually cured with salt, sugar, and spices. It can be bought raw but in most cases, it is sold cured. Usually, guanciale is cut into matchsticks or into thin strips and the fat is rendered, much like bacon. Often the guanciale fat is as important as the guanciale itself \u2013 in pasta sauces and salad dressing, it infuses the entire dish with richness and the saltiness from the pork.",
            "Guanciale is used most in the cooking of Lazio, the region of Italy that is home to Rome. Typical Roman pastas like carbonara, amatriciana, gricia all depend on the intensity and fattiness of guanciale. It's also often used on pizzas, in salads, and in a range of other dishes.",
            "Guanciale is salty, with a lot of richness from the fat, as well as distinct meatiness. If you like bacon, you're likely to also enjoy guanciale, though it is saltier than bacon. Unlike bacon, guanciale isn't typically smoked.",
            "The biggest difference between guanciale and pancetta is the part of the pig that they come from. While guanciale comes from the cheek of the pig, pancetta is made from the belly, much like bacon. Both pancetta and guanciale are sold cubed, but they are made in different forms. Guanciale is an oblong shape, usually the whole muscle of the cheek, while pancetta is often rolled.",
            "Guanciale is different from bacon in that it is made from pork cheek, not from pork belly. Guanciale is also unsmoked, whereas bacon is generally prized for its smokiness. The other major difference is the intensity of salt: while bacon is salty, it's delicious for eating straight. Guanciale is less appropriate for snacking because of the intensity of the salt levels.",
            "After it's been cut, the guanciale will last seven to ten days. Whole and well-wrapped in plastic wrap, it will last up to three weeks. For longer storage, it's best to tightly wrap the guanciale and freeze it. The fat that is rendered from the pork, which is great for all kinds of cooking, will last several months longer if stored in the refrigerator.",
            "Guanciale is a great way to add just a touch of richness and meatiness to any recipe. Here are a couple of classic dishes that lean on this savory ingredient",
            "This traditional carbonara recipe was created in the Lazio region (the area around Rome) in the middle of the 20th century, after World War II. It utilizes guanciale, eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and lots of black pepper to create the signature flavor.",

Whether draping it over a pizza, tossing cubed pieces into a salad, or stacking it high on a sandwich or panino, mortadella can offer meat lovers a new treat to fall for. Read on to learn about the origins of mortadella, how it's different from bologna, and what to do with it.",
            "Mortadella is a type of emulsified sausage made with pork meat, fat, pistachios, and black pepper. Emulsification, in this case, refers to a process of grinding high-quality, cooked pork extremely into a fine, silky texture. The sausage is then mixed with pieces of pork fat, toasted pistachios, and black pepper before it is set inside the casing.",
            "When sliced, mortadella has a kind of marbled look. Mortadella originated in Bologna, Italy, and some of the highest quality mortadella still come from the city and the surrounding region of Emilia Romagna, which is also known for the production of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and Lambrusco wine.",
            "Mortadella is luscious and rich but also incredibly well-balanced. Because the meat is emulsified, when sliced thinly it's incredibly delicate as well, so it doesn't taste overwhelming or leave an unpleasant texture on the palate. The black peppercorns and pistachios offer a wonderfully unique texture that makes the experience of snacking on mortadella totally addictive.",
            "The American lunch meat we know as bologna is derived from Italian mortadella, but if you don't like bologna, don't give up on mortadella just yet. Italian mortadella, especially the kind made in the region of Emilia-Romagna, is made with high-quality, pork from well-cared-for pigs. Bologna, on the other hand, is often made from a blend of meats, including beef and pork.",
            "Italian mortadella is usually made from the pig's cheek and back, whereas bologna is made from the leftover meat from a processed pig's skeleton. The name bologna actually comes from the Italian city of Bologna, where mortadella is made.",
            "Some grocery store deli counters will carry mortadella. If yours doesn't, seek it out at any specialty Italian grocery store or sandwich shop, or find it online.",
            "Once thinly sliced for sandwiches or charcuterie boards, mortadella will dry out but can be kept tightly wrapped in the refrigerator for up to a week. Thicker pieces will last about the same amount of time or can be frozen for longer storage."

            "Whether it's wrapped around slender stalks of asparagus, draped over juicy slices of melon, delicately placed on flatbreads, or lovingly piled on charcuterie boards, the near impossibly thin ham known as prosciutto is everywhere. With its pink hues, heavenly texture, and culinary versatility (no cooking required!), there's no wonder why this Italian specialty is popular around the world.",
            "Prosciutto translated from Italian is \"ham.\" Specifically, it's a thinly sliced, dry cured ham, the technique for which is a time-honored, regionally specific Italian custom.This prized ham's origins date to pre-Roman times, when winters were long, and the villagers took to dry-aging their pork legs to extend their meat supply. Since then, the tradition has been perfected century after century, resulting in the celebrated and delicious art it is today.",
            "First, high-quality pork legs are covered in salt and rested in a cool, dry place for weeks to concentrate the flavor. Next, the legs are hung in a cool, humid room for 2-3 months. Finally, they are washed, seasoned by hand (according to family recipe), and dry-aged for 14-36 months at a controlled temperature. Production varies by region and producer.",
            "The delicately sweet signature flavor of prosciutto is a direct result of the combination of salt, air, and time. Depending on the region it's produced, it can have an almost fruity flavor profile, or it may be earthier and slightly gamey. As with other aged products, the longer the time, the more complex it will taste, though prosciutto will always have a beautiful subtlety to it.",
            "Each piece is streaked with luxurious fat and can range in color from salmon pink to brownish-red to orangey, when aged at length. Over time, prosciutto becomes firmer, dryer, and darker. These fine slices are perfectly savory with an enjoyable buttery slickness. Just placing a piece on your tongue will melt the fat and morph it into a creamy texture coating your palate in salty, yet subtly sweet yumminess.",
            "The Italian certification DOP (Denominazioned' Origine Protetta), roughly translated to \"protected designation of origin\" was created to protect names of regions and their agricultural products and can be a useful tool in spotting differences.",
            "Prosciutto crudo",
            "Prosciutto crudo is the general term for raw cured ham. Chances are, unless specified as cotto (which is cooked), prosciutto on a menu or in a description is referring to crudo.",
            "Prosciutto di Parma",
            "DOP signifies that the ham's entire salting to aging process took place in the Parma province (the air and climate both having a unique effect on the meat's flavor), and that the meat is from a carefully selected heritage breed pig. If Parma sounds familiar, it's because it's the same region that Parmesan comes from.",
            "Prosciutto di San Daniele",
            "This DOP is made entirely in the Friuli Venezia region, the higher altitudes and different climate meaning a darker and sweeter flavor. With Prosciutto di San Danielle, the ham undergoes a pressing after salting, flattening the ham and encouraging salt penetration, resulting in a recognizable guitar shape.",
            "Yes! Prosciutto is sliced and served raw with the intent that it is consumed that way. The salt used in the preparation draws out blood and moisture, preventing bacteria from entering the meat \u2013 making it safe to eat as is. In fact, cooking it is generally frowned upon. Most people (especially Italians) feel that a such an artisan product should be enjoyed exactly how it is \u2014 perhaps complimented simply by items like melon, fresh figs, toasted bread, or Parmigiano-Reggiano.",
            "Prosciutto needs no alteration to be completely delicious, but it's also perfect as part of a lovely charcuterie spread, paired with fruit, cheese, vegetables, bread, and preserves. Prosciutto with a shorter age time can be stirred into pasta or placed on pizza. Longer-aged varieties should be enjoyed on their own to appreciate the deeper, more complex flavor.",
            "Though cooking it isn't the best way to go, chopping up the ends that can't be sliced and cooking them into soups or stews to enhance the flavor is a great idea. And, as a bonus, these ends are usually available on the cheap from any place that slices its own prosciutto.",
            "Once sliced, the ham begins to oxidize and lose its flavor. Try to enjoy it immediately after purchasing or opening. Whole legs, on the other hand, last up to 6 months in cool, dry places."
