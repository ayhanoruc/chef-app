            "If you asked the average person to name their five favorite cookies, lace cookies (a.k.a. Florentine cookies), wouldn't make it on to many of those lists. That's kind of surprising for several reasons: First of all, they'reincredibly simple to prepare. Also, the dough only takes minutes to make. Finally, they are very adaptable \u2014 the same technique works beautifully no matter which nuts or type of chocolate you use.",
            "Maybe it's the fact that these are closer to a candy than a cookie, but whatever the reason, they are very much underrated. You can also add \"durable\" to their list of adjectives, which is why they make for such a great edible gift.",
            "Please note: The baking time given here is only a rough estimate. Depending on the particulars of your pan, oven, and portion size, your actual time might be a few minutes off either way. So forget about time and go by appearance instead. These should be baked until golden brown with a slightly darker golden brown ring around the outside.",
            "Once they're cool and crisp, they are ready to be spread and sandwiched with chocolate. Or, if you're one of these people who are only able to eat one cookie at a time, you can drizzle the chocolate over the tops instead. Speaking of cool and crisp, while these are still warm, you can roll or bend them into whatever shapes you want. A scoop of vanilla ice cream is nice, but imagine how much nicer it would be served in an edible lace cookie cup? So, whether you make these as shown or bend them to you will, I really do hope you give them a try soon. Enjoy!",

            "Tiramisu usually contains alcohol. Marsala wine is the traditional choice, but this recipe calls for a mixture of strong coffee and rum. If you prefer not to use alcohol, just leave it out. It will still be delicious with just the coffee alone (just make sure the coffee is extra strong).",

            "\"This is my absolute favorite, tried-and-true recipe for tiramisu,\" according to Allie Kate Paterson. \"It is better-than-restaurant quality and so easy to make! The hardest part about making it is keeping your hands off of it while it sets in the fridge. The only tweak I make to this recipe is using Kahlua instead of plain rum.\"",

            "As you're probably starting to realize, I really love the flavor combinations in tiramisu, and I've featured them in multiple video recipes. While I love the classic version, I'm not the biggest fan of soggy ladyfinger cookies in a dessert, which is something I think I caught from Michele, but anyway, I love the combination of coffee and marsala wine in any sweet treat. Especially if that sweet treat is a feather-light semifreddo.",
            "If you're not familiar, semifreddo is basically a frozen mousse, hence the recipe's name, and it's probably the easiest way to make something similar to ice cream without an ice cream maker, or any other special equipment. You do need a few mixing bowls, and the ability to work a whisk, or an electric mixer, but other than that, the procedure is dead simple.",
            "Regarding the electric mixer, I much prefer to do this by hand, since both the whites and cream only take a few minutes to whip up, and you're much less likely to over-whisk. If you go too far with the cream, you'll be enjoying butter, and over-whipped whites become dry and grainy, and more difficult to fold in. So, don't do either of those things. But, whether you enjoy the convenience of power tools, or go manual, I really loved this technique, and this great dessert, and hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!",

Whisk constantly until mixture thickens and drippings from the whisk form ribbons on the surface that are visible for 1\/2 second to 1 second, about 10 minutes. If you are \"brave\", you can set the bowl directly over medium-low heat and thicken the egg cream that way, but you have to be careful so you don't end up with scrambled eggs. This last method is slightly faster and will take about 6 to 7 minutes.",
