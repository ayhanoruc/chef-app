            "The cannoli is a decadent, rich, and absolutely irresistible staple of Italian cuisine. If you've ever wanted to know more about the tubular dessert (including what it is, where it comes from, and how to make one at home), you've come to the right place. Here's what you need to know about cannolis:",
            "A cannoli is a tube-shaped Italian dessert that consists of fried pastry dough stuffed with a sweet, creamy cheese filling.",
            "The crispy pastry shell is made with the usual suspects: flour, sugar, whole eggs, and butter. It's usually spiked with marsala, a fortified wine that adds distinct flavor and sweetness. The alcohol also helps tenderize the pastry, ensuring a pleasantly flaky finished product.",
            "The creamy filling (often spiked with lemon or orange zest for subtle brightness) is made with sugar and ricotta cheese, but mascarpone is sometimes used. Finished cannolis are often dusted with powdered sugar.",
            "In many parts of Italy, a singular cannoli is called a \"cannolo\" and multiple cannolis are simply called \"cannoli.\" In the U.S., however, the accepted usage has become the singular \"cannoli\" and plural \"cannolis\" \u2013 so that's what we'll stick with for the remainder of this article.",
            "In Italian, \"cannoli\" is the plural of \"cannolo.\" \"Cannolo\" roughly translates to \"little tube.\"",
            "In a word, heavenly. Cannolis taste sweet, but not cloyingly so. The filling is rich, creamy, and smooth with a slight cheesy flavor. The shell is subtly sweet and crispy, but sturdy enough to support the thick filling.",
            "Sugar was introduced to Sicily sometime between 827 and 1091, when the island was under Arab rule and known as the Emirate of Sicily. This introduction paved the way for all sorts of Italian sweets we know and love \u2013 including the cannoli. The dessert was once known as cappelli di turchi, or Turkish hats, which proves that Sicilians believed the earliest cannolis had Middle Eastern roots.",
            "The cannoli is considered a modern day Sicilian staple, but it's particularly associated with Carnevale. Some say it originally served as a fertility symbol during the festival season.",
            "Cannolis and cream horns are both tube-shaped Italian desserts. However, they're not exactly the same thing.",
            "The cream horn has a puff pastry shell that's filled with sweetened whipped cream or custard. The cannoli, meanwhile, has a fried pastry shell that's filled with a ricotta mixture that tends to be denser than cream horn filling. Cannoli shells are generally much thinner and crispier than cream horn shells, which have the light and fluffy texture that's associated with puff pastry.",
            "There's more than one way to make a cannoli. Traditional cannolis have a simple filling of ricotta (or mascarpone), sugar, and sometimes vanilla extract. Here are a few common additions and variations:",
            "Though making bakery-worthy cannolis isn't exactly easy, it's probably not as hard as you think. You just need to know what you're doing. Here are some of our best tips and tricks to make perfect cannolis every time:",
            "Note: Of course, if you're short on time, you can always buy pre-made cannoli shells at the grocery store. They're usually found in the baking aisle or the international foods aisle.",

            "According to The New Food Lover's Companion, \"tiramisu\" translates as \"carry me up\" or \"pick me up,\" with the implication that you're being carried up to heaven. Which, of course, tends to happen when you eat a heavenly dessert like tiramisu.",

And what if it was like, kind of grown-up and sophisticated\u2026 as in, you could impress other people with it? Well, I have some excellent news: Budino is the answer to all of the above.",
            "In its simplest form, budino is an Italian pudding. But trust me, it's so much more than that. Made from a milk and egg custard thickened with cornstarch, budino is similar to American puddings and custards; however, budino tends to have a richer, eggier texture, akin to Mexican flan.",
            "Better still, budino almost always includes some type of crust, like crushed cookies, and a whipped cream-based topping. You'll often find other top layers, like salted caramel or butterscotch, included as well. In America, chocolate is a super popular flavor for pudding, but budino is a little different. The most common flavors are coffee, caramel (or butterscotch), vanilla, or honey. You don't often find fruit flavors, but you'll stumble upon the occasional lemon budino accompanied by a fruit compote in the summer months. Nuts like pistachios are a common final-touch topping, but crushed bits of biscotti or other crunchy cookies are also welcome additions.",

A plain vanilla budino comes together with ingredients \u2014 like milk, eggs, butter, and cornstarch \u2014 that home cooks often have on hand. Plus, the custard comes together in less than 20 minutes on the stovetop. Egg custards have the reputation of being tricky or complicated, which is why many people reach for a box of pudding mix over making it from scratch. That said, the method for making budino, which involves tempering the milk first and then bringing down the temperature of the custard mixture with cold milk and cornstarch, provides a bit more insurance against accidentally scrambling the eggs in your pudding.",

            "\"These are yummy,\" according to jacebanty, \"They taste like a sugar cookie, but a little smaller, fluffier and slightly more bland, which is perfect with the sweet frosting.\"",
            "\"Delicious,\" says Koekje. \"I wish I could give it more stars. This is a REAL winner. I made only a dozen to test the recipe. I think these cookies can be made without the icing and served with a sweet hot drink.\"",
            "\"These were so incredibly moist and delicious,\" raves stanleyandsammiesmom. \"They were gone by the next morning! Will definitely make them again!\"",

That's kind of surprising for several reasons: First of all, they'reincredibly simple to prepare. Also, the dough only takes minutes to make. Finally, they are very adaptable \u2014 the same technique works beautifully no matter which nuts or type of chocolate you use.",
            "Maybe it's the fact that these are closer to a candy than a cookie, but whatever the reason, they are very much underrated. You can also add \"durable\" to their list of adjectives, which is why they make for such a great edible gift.",

Depending on the particulars of your pan, oven, and portion size, your actual time might be a few minutes off either way. So forget about time and go by appearance instead. These should be baked until golden brown with a slightly darker golden brown ring around the outside.",
            "Once they're cool and crisp, they are ready to be spread and sandwiched with chocolate. Or, if you're one of these people who are only able to eat one cookie at a time, you can drizzle the chocolate over the tops instead. Speaking of cool and crisp, while these are still warm, you can roll or bend them into whatever shapes you want. A scoop of vanilla ice cream is nice, but imagine how much nicer it would be served in an edible lace cookie cup? So, whether you make these as shown or bend them to you will, I really do hope you give them a try soon. Enjoy!",

While I love the classic version, I'm not the biggest fan of soggy ladyfinger cookies in a dessert, which is something I think I caught from Michele, but anyway, I love the combination of coffee and marsala wine in any sweet treat. Especially if that sweet treat is a feather-light semifreddo.",

You do need a few mixing bowls, and the ability to work a whisk, or an electric mixer, but other than that, the procedure is dead simple.",
            "Regarding the electric mixer, I much prefer to do this by hand, since both the whites and cream only take a few minutes to whip up, and you're much less likely to over-whisk. If you go too far with the cream, you'll be enjoying butter, and over-whipped whites become dry and grainy, and more difficult to fold in. So, don't do either of those things. But, whether you enjoy the convenience of power tools, or go manual, I really loved this technique, and this great dessert, and hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!",
