            "Panzanella is a rustic, chopped summer salad that incorporates stale bread, vinegar, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a range of market-fresh ingredients for a bright, flavorful dish that's been celebrated for centuries. With roots in the Tuscan countryside, panzanella's name is said to be a mashup of the Italian words for bread and soup bowl, pane and zanella. Looking for the answer to your picnic and potluck needs? Toss together a vibrant, filling bread salad that you'll revisit again and again this season.",
            "The first panzanella was a simple mixture of onions, oil, vinegar, wild greens, and toast. Florentine poet Branzino first referenced the soaked-bread salad in the 16th century. The dish was onion-based until the 19th century, when tomatoes became synonymous with Italian cuisine and took over as the main ingredient. Recipes that mimicked the colors of the flag became increasingly popular during this time, and the fresh, budget-friendly salad stuck. Fast forward to modern times: a classic panzanella is made the same way, but extras like eggs, cheese, and olives are often thrown in for added flavor and heft.",
            "Panzanella originated in the central Italian countryside, where farmers combined surplus vegetables with old bread to cut down on waste. They soaked the bread in cold water to give it a chewy texture, then tossed it with vinegar, herbs, and onions for a wonderfully tangy bite. The humble dish made its way up the social class ladder, and was eventually served to King Vittorio in 1865. Italian immigrants then brought the delicious salad stateside.",
