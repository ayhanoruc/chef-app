            "No, Ezekiel bread isn't gluten-free. Even though the recipe doesn't contain traditional all-purpose flour, three of the ingredients (wheat berries, spelt flour, and barley) contain gluten.",
            "Store Ezekiel bread at room temperature for up to three days. After three days, you'll need to freeze it. The best way to freeze Ezekiel bread is in individual slices so you can thaw them as-needed.",
            "\"This bread has become our favorite,\" says jill stewart. \"I grind and bake it every two weeks. I keep the fresh small loaves in the freezer until we finish the previous loaf, and it is absolutely perfect. I don't just like this bread. It is the BEST bread that I have ever eaten.\"",
            "\"This is a very hearty bread,\" according to Connie Duran. \"Must be treated like a sweet bread, in that it holds together better if put in a plastic wrap and then used the next day. Very filling. Pleasant texture.\"",
            "\"This is a great diet meal for the money,\" says MelWad. \"It also makes a great french toast! I ran out of honey last time and substituted a small portion of molasses.\"",
