            "Place berries into a blender with water, sugar, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, and salt. Pulse several times to get the mixture moving, then blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour into a large baking dish; the mixture should only be about 3/8 inch deep in the dish.",
            "Place the uncovered dish into the freezer until the mixture barely begins to freeze around the edges, about 45 minutes, it will still be slushy in the center.",
            "Keeping the mixture in the freezer, use a fork to lightly stir the frozen crystals from the edges in towards the center; mix thoroughly. Close the freezer and continue to chill until granita is nearly frozen, 30 to 40 more minutes. Mix lightly again with a fork as before, scraping the crystals loose. Repeat freezing and stirring with the fork three to four more times until the crystals are separate and the granita looks dry and fluffy.",
            "Portion granita into small serving bowls to serve.",
            "This will work with other fruit and berry purees.",
            "Hull strawberries by using the tip of small, sharp paring knife inserted at a 45-degree angle near the hull. Rotate the berry to cut out a small cone containing the hull. It saves a little bit of fruit from each strawberry.",
            "Freezing times will vary greatly depending on how cold, empty, large, etc., your freezer is. Just keep checking and forking!",
