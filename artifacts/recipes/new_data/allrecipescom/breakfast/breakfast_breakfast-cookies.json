            "Combine the almond butter, canola oil, agave nectar, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract in the food processor and process a few seconds to blend the ingredients well; transfer the almond butter mixture to a large bowl and fold in the dried cherries and chocolate chips. Mix the walnut-oatmeal mixture into the almond butter mixture (dough will be very thick).",

            "Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and flatten the cookies with a spatula. Allow to cool for about 5 minutes on the baking sheets before removing to finish cooling on wire racks.",
            "The agave nectar (sometimes called blue agave, or raw agave syrup) comes from the agave plant. It is sweeter, less processed and has a lower glycemic index (releases glucose into the bloodstream at slower rate) than table sugar. You can substitute 1/3 cup brown sugar for agave (so a total of 2/3 cup brown sugar for this recipe), and add 1 egg white. I like the consistency of the cookie better with the agave."
