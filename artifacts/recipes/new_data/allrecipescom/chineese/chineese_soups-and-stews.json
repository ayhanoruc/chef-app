Adding some pork or little fun-sized meatballs would take it from appetizer to a fantastic meal. But no matter what additions you make, one thing that should not be omitted is the white pepper. It really does magical things here. I'd love to explain them in detail, but I can't. It just does things, and to fully understand what those things are, you're going to have to whip up a batch.
