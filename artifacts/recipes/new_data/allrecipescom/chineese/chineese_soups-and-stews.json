            "I was going to say this fast and easy-to-make hot and sour soup is \"better than take-out.\" But, in fairness, I have no idea how good your friendly neighborhood Chinese restaurant is. So instead of insulting restaurateurs I've never met, I'll just say that in my experience, this soup is way better than the typical offering.",
            "What all hot and sour soups have in common, besides being hot and sour, is their appetite-stimulating addictiveness. Once the spoon hits the bowl, it generally doesn't stop moving until the last drop has been consumed. I've never been a huge fan of soups as an appetizer, since they tend to fill me up, but that's not a problem for this soup. You actually get hungrier with each spoonful.",
            "Feel free to add almost anything else to the ingredient list, as I can't think of a better catch-all for using up forgotten vegetables from the fridge. Adding some pork or little fun-sized meatballs would take it from appetizer to a fantastic meal. But no matter what additions you make, one thing that should not be omitted is the white pepper. It really does magical things here. I'd love to explain them in detail, but I can't. It just does things, and to fully understand what those things are, you're going to have to whip up a batch. Which I hope you do very soon. Enjoy!",

            "Raise heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Stir the soup slowly with a spoon while transferring in the beaten eggs in a steady stream to create thin ribbons. Keep stirring until the soup comes back to a boil. Reduce heat to medium.",
            "Stir the cornstarch slurry to make sure it's well blended, then slowly drizzle it into the soup while stirring constantly. Soup should thicken up within 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat, taste for seasoning, and serve.",
            "You can definitely use fresh shiitake mushrooms instead of dried, but dried will give the soup a better flavor. Cold water also works to soften the dried mushrooms, it just takes longer. The amount listed for mushrooms (3/4 ounce) should be about 6 mushrooms.",
            "Use soft tofu for this. Use Chinese black vinegar instead of seasoned rice vinegar if you can find it. You can use a hot red pepper instead of a sweet one.",
            "This will work with a black pepper or cayenne instead of white pepper, but it's just not going to have the same flavor.",
