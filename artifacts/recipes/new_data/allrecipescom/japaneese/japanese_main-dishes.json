These Japanese noodles make the most satisfying noodle bowls you'll ever make. Soba noodles are made from buckwheat flour and many brands are gluten-free, but check the package to determine if wheat flour has been added.

            "\"Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries,\" explains MMSVA. \"It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. The curry roux, from no heat to very spicy, can be bought at any international grocery store. It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is very flexible.\"",
            "This easy recipe is ready in less than 20 minutes. Ground beef quickly cooks in a super-simple sauce made with freshly grated ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and a little sugar. Makes a great mid-week meal served with rice.",
            "\"Traditional Japanese beef sukiyaki recipe for a one-pot recipe that is cooked at the table. Delicious when dipped in raw beaten egg and eaten with rice,\" says Brenda Sawyer Adamson.",
            "Thin slices of sirloin steak are marinated in a sweet and savory combination of mirin and soy, rolled around pieces of green onion, and broiled or grilled.",
            "You'll roll thin slices of beef around blanched asparagus and shiitake mushrooms. \"It can be put together in advance and cooked only minutes before you're ready to eat,\" says Elegant Chef. \"A healthy and filling meal, it can be served with rice, or for the carb-conscious, by itself.\"",
            "You might also like:",
            "Call on the Instant Pot to create a Japanese-style curry with tender slices of beef and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce. \"Japanese curry is easily one of the top national dishes of Japan, behind sushi, ramen, and miso soup,\" says Diana71. \"It is distinctly Japanese, varying enough from Indian or Thai curries to be its own. Making Japanese curry in the Instant Pot\u00ae ensures the texture is perfect, and the meat, if used, is tender and juicy. What I was taught growing up: always, always use the roux as a base. Serve with rice!\"",
            "In this Japanese-inspired slow cooker recipe, you'll combine a beef roast with broth, rice wine, ginger, and soy sauce. \"This is a delicious roast adapted from a common recipe for cooking beef in Japan,\" says carnegie, the recipe submitter."

It comes served on soft, buttery, slightly sweet Japanese milk bread, which is the perfect delivery system. Plus, the salad is bound together with a super savory mayonnaise that, as my old buddy Guy Fieri might say, would taste great on a flip flop. The most popular brand of this mayo is called Kewpie, which is pretty easy to find. But just in case, I show a fairly close version using commonly found pantry ingredients.",

This Japanese fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and intensely flavorful, which is even more impressive when you consider the fact that there is no skin or bones involved. However, not all karaage recipes are created equal, and the awesomeness is very much dependent on how and what you coat your chicken pieces in.",
            "For me, the secret to impossibly crispy karaage is pure potato starch. While I'm not known for my extensive, and exhaustive, recipe testing, I did many, many tests and experiments, using pretty much every possible combination of starch options; wheat flour, rice flour, cornstarch, et al., and potato starch was the winner. By the way, do not accidentally buy potato flour, which is not the same thing, and will not work the same. If you can't find potato starch, which you can, I think cornstarch is the next best option.",
            "Above and beyond the coating starch, the marinade also varies from recipe to recipe, but most contain what I've used here, give or take a splash of mirin, and you shouldn't hesitate to experiment with different ratios. No matter what you use, I think a 2-3 hours marinade is perfect, but like I said in the video, anywhere from 1 to 10 hours is considered appropriate. No matter how long your soak, I hope you find some potato starch, and give this incredible fried chicken a try soon. Enjoy!",

            "Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Stir to coat with marinade. Toss 2 or 3 pieces at a time in the potato starch until evenly coated. Shake off any excess starch and place chicken on the wire rack. Repeat to dredge remaining pieces.",

            "Without crowding, lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry, tossing occasionally, until cooked through and the outside is crunchy and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken.",
            "If you can't find mirin, you can use sake plus an extra teaspoon of white sugar. You can use cornstarch instead of potato starch, but don't use potato flour! It's not the same as potato starch.",
            "For crispier, darker karaage that's made in two steps and great for a party, try the double-fry method! Follow instructions to Step 6. Fry chicken as directed in step 7, but only fry for 1 \u00bd to 2 minutes. Remove to a rack and let cool to room temperature. Finish by frying at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 2 more minutes. Chicken can be refrigerated until the second fry.",

Added some chicken, carrots, bean sprouts, and green beans, and it reminded me of the Thai chicken from The Cheesecake Factory,\" says VIRGINIA ADDIS.",

It is very important to use fresh udon noodles. If you use packaged dry noodles, they will get very soggy and the texture ruins the dish.

            "The perfect stick-to-your ribs recipe for a cold day, this chicken soup is full of chewy udon noodles, bok choy, and shiitake mushrooms. Best part? It's ready is just over half an hour.",
            "In this recipe, hearty udon noodles are swimming in a curry-spiced broth with carrots and onions. \"Honestly one of the best recipes I have found so far! Really easy and fast to make,\" says reviewer Kayla Mod.",
            "This cool salad is super easy to make, just requiring the chopping of a few ingredients and stirring together a simple sauce. Let it sit for the suggested 4 hours or longer, the flavors will continue to develop.",
            "\"The noodles are springy and work perfectly with this dish,\" says Jasmine. \"The broth for this dish is very umami and slightly fishy with subtle notes of seaweed. The aburaage is soft and easy to eat, and contributes a lot of the dish's overall flavor. This can be served with fish cakes as well.\"",
            "Ultra comforting, creamy, and with a hint of spice, this egg drop soup is made better with the addition of broken up udon noodles. Garnish with flavorful toppings like green onions, red chili flakes, and an extra drizzle of sesame oil.",
            "\"Sweet with a touch of heat and very light. With minimum cooking, this is perfect for a summer night,\" says recipe creator NumNum. \"Garnish with cilantro, sesame seeds, and lime wedges, if desired.\"",

This noodle bowl comes together in less than thirty minutes and is effortless!\" says thedailygourmet. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and green onions.",
            "These simple sesame noodles are ready in less than 30 minutes.

            "Make your own sushi! Making sushi at home is surprisingly simple. We'll start with how to make sushi for beginners, which means sushi rolls. With just a little practice, you can make sushi rolls at home that are as dazzling to look at as they are delicious to eat.",
            "Today, we're making a variation on the California roll. Along with sushi rice and sheets of seaweed (nori), California rolls require only a few ingredients: crab meat (or imitation), avocado, and cucumber. If you like, mix the crab meat with a little mayo to create a creamy consistency.",
            "To this basic list of ingredients, we've added sliced carrots and cooked shrimp...because that's how we (sushi) roll. Before we got further, a quick note on sushi rice. You can't use just any rice for sushi. Sushi rice is a special preparation of rice flavored with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. It's made from short-grain rice (Japonica), typically made in Japan and parts of California and Italy. With homemade sushi rice, you're aiming for rice that's fluffy and a little sticky but not too sticky. Give it a try -- you'll get the hang of it. See how to make sushi rice.",
            "To make sushi at home, you'll need a few essential tools for making sushi:",
            "This is the traditional way to roll any type of rolled sushi, which is called maki sushi. There are actually two options for this method: rolling with the sushi rice on top of the sheet of nori, as we do here; or with the nori flipped over so the rice ends up on the outside of the finished roll (uramaki sushi).",
            "1. Place the bamboo rolling mat (you can get one for as little as $7 on Amazon) on a cutting board so the bamboo strips are running horizontally to you. Spread a strip of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat. Then place a sheet (or a half sheet) of nori on the plastic wrap.",
            "2. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori. (See below for more about making perfect sushi rice.)",
            "Don't use too much rice. With a little practice, you'll get a feel for how much rice to use. We're spreading about 1 cup of rice per whole sheet of nori, leaving a small space at the top edge of the nori so you can seal up the roll.",
            "PRO TIP: Wet your fingers as you spread the sticky sushi rice over the nori.",
            "3. Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered nori. Don't overpack it. If you're making a roll with the rice on the outside, simply turn the nori over, placing it rice-side down on the rolling mat. Then add your ingredients to the top of the nori.",
            "4. Gently lift the bottom of the mat up and over the sushi. Press and shape the ingredients into a tube. Roll with pressure so you get a firm roll.",
            "5. Roll until just an inch of nori shows at the top. Seal the edge of the nori with a little cold water. Firm it up by squeezing the mat around the roll until it feels uniformly snug. Be careful not to squeeze so hard that the ingredients are smashed or come oozing out the sides. It's a fine line; with practice you'll get the feel of it.",
            "6. Slice the sushi roll in half with a sharp knife on a cutting board. Then cut each half into thirds -- so you have 6 pieces of sushi. To get a nice clean cut, wet the knife with water each time you make a slice.",
            "7. Line the slices of sushi up on platters or sushi plates. Enjoy with soy sauce, wasabi paste, and pickled ginger, and a little chopped daikon if you like.",
            "OK, now let's watch sushi chef Hitoshi make a California roll. You'll notice he rolled his in the inside-out style, with the rice on the outside of the nori -- and he garnished the rice with a sprinkling of roe. Because he's a pro.",
