It's an essential ingredient in many classic Japanese dishes \u2014 miso soup, noodle dishes, stews, and more. You can find dashi granules and dashi powder for instant dashi broth at well-stocked grocery stores. But it's actually quite simple to make homemade dashi. And the flavor of homemade dashi can be more subtle than store-bought instant dashi.",
