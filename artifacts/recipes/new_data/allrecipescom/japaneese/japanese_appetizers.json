            "This top-rated tamago recipe seems intimidating, but it\u2019s surprisingly easy to make at home!",
            "Tamago (a.k.a. tamagoyaki) is a Japanese omelet. It\u2019s made by rolling together thin layers of fried eggs, then slicing the log into rectangles. Since the egg is mixed with dashi, sugar, and mirin, the finished product has a complex and subtly sweet flavor. Tamago is traditionally served for breakfast or as a sushi ingredient.",
            "These are the ingredients you\u2019ll need to make this tamago recipe:",
            "You\u2019ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below \u2013 but here\u2019s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make tamago at home:",
            "Tip from recipe creator Pokerman11: It is best to use a tamago pan, which is a 5x7-inch square nonstick frying pan, but any small pan will work \u2014 you just won't have square ends on your finished omelet.",
            "Enjoy the homemade tamago right away or freeze it for up to two weeks. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator.",
            "\u201cThis was a great recipe,\u201d according to one Allrecipes community member. \u201cI did not have the dashi, so I substituted with chicken broth and a splash of seasoned rice wine vinegar. It was great.\u201d",
            "\u201cSo yummy and easy,\u201d raves NicholeB. \u201cI used a round skillet and it worked great. Probably not as pretty, but tasted fantastic.\u201d",
            "Editorial contributions by Corey Williams",
            "Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; whisk in dashi stock, sugar, mirin, and soy sauce until sugar has dissolved.",
            "Lightly grease a nonstick skillet and heat over medium heat.",
            "Pour a thin layer of egg mixture into the hot pan and swirl to coat the pan. Cook until egg layer is firm on the bottom but still slightly liquid on top, about 1 minute. Then lift up one edge using a spatula and roll up the egg layer. Push omelet roll to one side of the skillet. Oil the skillet again and pour in another thin layer of egg, lifting the first omelet roll up slightly to allow the egg to flow underneath; roll up the first omelet in the new layer of egg and push omelet to the edge of the skillet as before. Repeat the process with the remaining egg mixture, oiling the pan each time if needed.",
            "Remove rolled omelet to a serving platter and cut into 6 equal pieces to serve."
