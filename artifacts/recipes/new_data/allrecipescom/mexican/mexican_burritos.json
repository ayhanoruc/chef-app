Even an experienced flipper such as myself had an issue (although, in fairness, I was doing it from the side so as not to block the camera). But still, if there's a flaw with this technique, that's it.",

Besides the ingredients being more harmonized, we also get 100% of the surface area of our tortilla browned and crispy. Get in there and practice, and, as always, enjoy!",
