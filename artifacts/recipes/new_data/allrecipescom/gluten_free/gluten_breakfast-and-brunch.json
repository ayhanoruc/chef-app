If you choose a chocolate witha high percentage of cacao (70% or higher), it really doesn't contain an alarming amount of sugar \u2014 but it does feature a surprisingly high amount of fiber and disease-fighting antioxidants. Plus, studies show that chocolate makes people feel good after they eat it, so there's that.",

Save those for the time we make regular, non-breakfast donuts. Regardless of how you adapt yours, I really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!",
