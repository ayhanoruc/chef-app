Traditional ingredients include tomatoes, onions, serrano or jalapeno peppers, cilantro, and sometimes lime juice. Other spices and seasonings are often used. Since it contains less liquid than other salsa varieties, pico de gallo can be used in a variety of ways. It can be served with chips for dipping, used as a topping for tacos, or included as an ingredient in burritos and quesadillas.",
