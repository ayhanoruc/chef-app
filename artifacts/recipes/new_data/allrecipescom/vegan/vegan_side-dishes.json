            "While large carving pumpkins are perfect for creating festive Jack-O\u2019-Lanterns, they\u2019re not ideal for making pumpkin puree. The best pumpkins for puree are sugar pumpkins, which are small, round, and orange. The smaller the pumpkin, the better \u2014 large pumpkins tend to have more moisture and less flavor.",
            "It couldn\u2019t be simpler to make pumpkin puree at home: Cut the pumpkin in half, remove the seeds and pulp, cover each half in foil, and bake until tender. Scrape the flesh from the halves and puree, then strain to remove any remaining stringy pieces.",

Thaw overnight in the refrigerator.",

            "\u201cThis was simple and worked great,\u201d according to Stacy Bermes. \u201cI used smaller (softball-size) pumpkins and put them in the fridge overnight. This made the flesh easier to scrape out and allowed the shells to harden again.\u201d",
