            "While large carving pumpkins are perfect for creating festive Jack-O\u2019-Lanterns, they\u2019re not ideal for making pumpkin puree. The best pumpkins for puree are sugar pumpkins, which are small, round, and orange. The smaller the pumpkin, the better \u2014 large pumpkins tend to have more moisture and less flavor.",
            "It couldn\u2019t be simpler to make pumpkin puree at home: Cut the pumpkin in half, remove the seeds and pulp, cover each half in foil, and bake until tender. Scrape the flesh from the halves and puree, then strain to remove any remaining stringy pieces.",

            "Yes! Pumpkin puree freezes well. If you want the pumpkin puree to last for more than a week, you\u2019ll need to freeze it. You can freeze larger quantities in a zip-top bag and smaller quantities in a muffin tin or ice cube tray. Pumpkin puree will last for up to one year in the freezer. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator.",
            "\u201cIt is very easy and simple to make,\u201d says Pumpkin Seed. \u201cJust make sure you completely cover each pumpkin piece with foil, which will allow it to cook much faster.\u201d",

            "\u201cThis was simple and worked great,\u201d according to Stacy Bermes. \u201cI used smaller (softball-size) pumpkins and put them in the fridge overnight. This made the flesh easier to scrape out and allowed the shells to harden again.\u201d",
