            "Dessert and the Daniel Fast don't exactly go hand in hand. The entire idea behind this biblically-based fast is that you would set aside indulgences and focus on plant-based meals for 21 days as an act of worship and sacrifice. It's essentially a vegan diet that prohibits added sugars, refined carbs, caffeine, and alcohol (here you'll find a complete list of Daniel Fast-approved foods). All that being said, keeping cravings at bay can be difficult when you completely cut yourself off from any sort of sweet treat. These eight Daniel Fast desserts (we're using a loose definition of \"dessert\") feature healthy ingredients like fresh fruit and nuts to keep your sweet tooth satisfied.",
            "While you may not be able to indulge in chocolate-chip cookies on the Daniel Fast, these healthy cookies will curb your cravings in the meantime. Ripe bananas, oats, and dates make up the bulk of these chewy cookies. Reviewer SHASTASHEEN says, \"This is a great recipe, the cookies were moist, chewy, and very sweet despite being sugar-free.\"",
            "Yep, you can have ice cream on the Daniel Fast. This homemade ice cream is dairy-free and free of added sugars.",
            "While this might not be a dessert per say, the air fryer brings a nice crisp to otherwise plain fruit. \"Roasted pineapple is a delicious addition to so many dishes,\" says recipe creator Yoly.",
            "Indulge yourself in a loaf of spiced banana bread without any of the guilt. This vegan recipe is free of any added sugar. Reviewer Aishakb raves, \"This will become a regular of mine for family or holidays!\"",
            "\"Healthier than flour and sugar recipes, these muffins are naturally sweet, filling, egg-free, and protein-rich. Kid-tested and approved,\" says recipe creator Fran Purdhomme.",
            "When you're on a restrictive diet like the Daniel Fast, smoothies absolutely count as a dessert. Unlike other smoothies that often call for dairy or sweeteners, this recipe is made entirely with fruit and 100-percent fruit juice.",
            "Swap high-sugar candy bars for this healthy snack bar made with slivered almonds, flaked coconut, dates, and cashews. Plus they'll give you an energy boost. Take it from recipe creator Lacy Wilson who says, \"As an outdoor professional I take these in the back country and they need not be refrigerated and give great energy.\"",
            "This recipe contains brown rice syrup, which some argue isn't Daniel Fast-approved because it constitutes as a sweetener. But if you're okay with brown rice syrup on the Daniel Fast, these peanut butter balls are the perfect way to curb your cravings. Reviewer Lisa Harwood-Stamper Burns made the recipe without brown rice syrup: \"...I made this recipe without the brown rice syrup, but with vanilla extract and a little almond extract.\""

            "\u00b7 Flour: These easy vegan gingerbread cookies start with all-purpose flour.\n\u00b7 Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cookies rise.\n\u00b7 Spices: These festive cookies are spiced with cinnamon, ginger, and allspice. A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but won't make your cookies taste salty.\n\u00b7 Coconut oil: Since this recipe is vegan, it calls for coconut oil instead of butter or shortening.\n\u00b7 Molasses: Use molasses to deepen the spicy flavor of these vegan gingerbread cookies.\n\u00b7 Sugar: White sugar sweetens things up a bit, balancing out the deeper flavors from the molasses and spices.\n\u00b7 Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract adds complexity and enhances the flavor.",
            "You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below \u2014 but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these vegan gingerbread cookies:",
            "1. Make and chill the dough: Sift the dry ingredients together. Beat the wet ingredients in a separate bowl. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture to make dough. Wrap the dough in storage wrap and refrigerate for two hours.\n2. Roll and cut the dough: Roll the chilled dough out onto a floured surface. Use a floured cookie cutter to cut the dough into your desired shapes.\n3. Bake the cookies: Place the cut cookie dough on lined baking sheets. Bake in a preheated oven until firm and cool completely on wire racks.",

When they're frozen solid, transfer them to an airtight container or zip-top bag. Freeze for up to one month. Thaw in the refrigerator, then decorate as desired.\n\u00b7 To freeze cookie dough, arrange the dough balls on a baking sheet and freeze them for a few hours or up to overnight. When they're frozen solid, transfer them to an airtight container or zip-top bag. Freeze for up to two months. Follow the recipe when you're ready to eat them, but add a few minutes to the bake time to account for the frozen temperature.",
            "\"Wonderful,\" raves Riley. \"Super easy and tasty. I used soy-free, dairy-free 'butter' instead of coconut oil.\"",
            "\"We cooked [the dough] for 9 minutes because I prefer a chewier cookie and they were amazing,\" says Sarah Driscoll. \"Be sure not to roll the dough too thin.\"",
            "\"I followed the directions exactly and these cookies were delicious,\" according to Sara Baird. \"For me, \u00bd-inch thickness was easier to cut and made cleaner cut cookies.\"",
