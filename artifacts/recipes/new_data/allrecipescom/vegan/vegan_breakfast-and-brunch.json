These five plant-based biscuit recipes prove that with a little technique and the right ingredient swaps, you can easily create fluffy and buttery vegan biscuits. So whether you eat them as a side or smother them in vegan gravy for breakfast, it's time to get baking. Perhaps your new favorite biscuits just might be vegan!",

            "\"Vegan\" and \"buttery\" may seem like they don't belong in the same sentence, but this recipe will change your mind. By using high-quality vegan butter (we like the Earth Balance brand) you can infuse these biscuits with plenty of flavor and perfect texture.",

These 15 vegan-friendly recipes range between sweet and savory, featuring favorites like tofu breakfast bowls, chocolate chip pancakes, and even eggplant \"bacon.\"",
            "Equal parts beloved and bullied, avocado toast is definitely a food people have opinions about. And with 100+ positive reviewers, our opinion is that this recipe is a winner.",
            "Get the protein and fiber of oatmeal, but in the form of delightfully fluffy chocolate pancakes. If you have picky eaters who may shy away from oatmeal, the oats can be blended into a smooth flour before using.",
            "\"Tofu scrambles up just like eggs, and with some clever spices, even non-vegans will barely notice the difference,\" says recipe creator Isa Chandra. \"Try setting out toppings to let family or guests assemble their own burrito bowls.\"",
            "Flax seed meal is the secret ingredient to these fluffy waffles. The seeds thicken up when added to water, acting as a plant-based egg alternative.",
            "Seasoned and blended firm tofu is the base for this egg-free quiche. Reviewer RASACS says, \"Very yummy \u2014 my husband had no idea it was tofu.\"",
            "If chai tea is your favorite way to start the day, then this spiced oatmeal is a sure winner. Cardamom, cinnamon, and ginger dress up this healthy bowl of oats and chia seeds.",
            "\"TVP, oats, and a variety of herbs and spices provide a vegan alternative to breakfast sausage in this easy recipe,\" says recipe creator Breanna Ford. \"Dough can be rolled into a log, stored in plastic wrap, and kept in the fridge for up to a week, or cooked immediately.\"",
            "Smashing is the best technique for these baby potatoes, creating delightfully fluffy interiors with a crispy crust outside. Layer them up in a bowl with veggies and tofu for a filling breakfast.",
            "Eggplant is magically transformed into a faux bacon. While crispier than the meat version, these strips can be served on the side or stuffed into a breakfast BLT. Make sure to use vegetarian Worcestershire for this recipe, since the traditional kind contains anchovies.",
            "In the same vegetable family as cabbage and broccoli, kohlrabi is a mild root veggie that's perfect for breakfast. Everything bakes together on the same sheet pan, meaning you can have breakfast done with only one dirty dish.",
            "\"Chickpea flour and lightly saut\u00e9ed vegetables recreate an eggless frittata or open-faced omelette,\" says recipe creator Buckwheat Queen. \"A delicious \u2014 not too dense, not too fluffy \u2014 must-have on your brunch table.\"",
            "Hearty tempeh, made from fermented soybeans, is the star of this recipe. It's crumbled and simmered in spices before being formed into bite-size \"sausage\" patties.",
            "When crumbled, firm tofu takes on a shockingly similar textured to scrambled eggs. A touch of turmeric adds the yellow color, while nutritional yeast and garlic powder add flavor.",
            "\"You can't tell at all that these muffins don't have any dairy or eggs,\" says recipe creator MIEKO1. \"They are moist and yummy. My kids and husband polish them off as soon as they are out of the oven!\"",
            "Rice paper is the secret ingredient to this extra crispy plant-based bacon. A spiced blend of soy sauce, maple syrup, and liquid smoke is key to getting the right flavor."
