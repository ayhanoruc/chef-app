Pillowy soft grains of rice and a crunchy tahdig layer are the trademarks of Persian rice, the beloved rice dish that combines aromatic flavor and irresistible texture. Check out our collection of Persian rice recipes, including bright and herby sabzi polo, lubia polo, a textural delight, and, of course, crispy, buttery tahdig.",
            "This recipe by Chef John breaks down the processes that yield Persian rice's signature qualities: fluffy grains, the tahdig layer, and some bonus potato tahdig nestled on top. It's not quite how my grandmother makes it, but it's definitely worth trying.",
            "Packed with fresh herbs and lima beans, sabzi polo gets its name from its green hue. This dish is famously paired with fried fish (mahi sorkh shodeh) on Nowruz, the Persian new year, but it also works well with chicken or salmon. Don't pair this with a khoresht stew unless you want to break the Iranian dining code.",
            "Kalam polo, a rice dish made with beef, vegetables, and herbs, is a traditional and aromatic Persian dish. To make a vegetarian version, simply omit the beef. Pair it with shirazi salad to round it out as a meal.",
            "This one-pot rice dish is a weeknight staple in many Persian households. For a more authentic version of this dish, omit the jalapenos and replace the curry with saffron and turmeric.",
            "\"Reshteh polo is a fragrant rice and noodle dish often served at Nowruz (Iranian New Year) for lunch or dinner,\" says creator and Bottom of the Pot author Naz Deravian. \"You can purchase the roasted noodles from Iranian markets or online. The noodles in this dish symbolize good wishes for the new year.\"",
            "\"This is one of my husband's favorite foods! Good with some plain yogurt too,\" says community member Donnell Shariat. \"The recipe takes practice but pays off since the procedure is a common one for Persian Rice recipes.\"",
            "Bahgali polo, which translates to \"beans and rice,\" sounds simple, but the dish goes far beyond those two ingredients. It's traditionally made with lamb and gets much of its robust taste from dried dill. This recipe is easily adaptable to suit a different type of meat or even no meat at all, but the one ingredient you can't omit is the yogurt.",
            "Bottom of the Pot author Naz Deravian's sabzi polo recipe includes some clever damage control in the form of a lavash tahdig, which helps keep the rice's herbs from burning. For best results, use a long-grain basmati rice."

It is a holiday that begins exactly at the moment of the equinox \u2014 the first day of Spring \u2014 and lasts for 13 days. It's a joyous celebration of nature, new life, and new beginnings. There are many symbolic traditions and rituals that are observed during Nowruz, and naturally food plays a major role in the festivities. The customary dishes prepared during Nowruz include sabzi polo ba mahi (green herb rice and fried fish), kookoo sabzi (fresh herb frittata), and reshteh polo (noodle rice). The ingredients used in these dishes \u2014 such as a bounty of fresh green herbs, eggs, and noodles \u2014 symbolize spring, nature and well wishes for the new year. Iranians typically have a love affair with cooking with an abundance of fresh green herbs and it is on full display at a Nowruz feast with these delicious recipes.",
            "Sabzi Polo is traditionally served for Nowruz dinner or lunch. 'Sabz' in Persian means green and the abundance of fresh green herbs in this dish symbolizes new life and rebirth. Sabzi polo is typically served with a fish dish like mahi sorkh shodeh (fried fish) and mahi doodi (smoked fish).",
            "A Nowruz meal would be incomplete without fish, and mahi sorkh shodeh (fried fish) often accompanies sabzi polo (green herb rice). Fish symbolize life and fertility. White fish is traditionally prepared, but any kind of fish is welcome at the table.",
            "Kookoo sabzi is the embodiment of the spirit of Nowruz. This particular kookoo (Persian-style frittata) is packed with just about every fresh green herb in the Iranian crisper. The green herbs represent new life and the eggs in this dish symbolize fertility. Serve kookoo sabzi with sabzi polo (green herb rice) and mahi sorkh shodeh (fried fish), or enjoy with bread.",
            "The noodles in this fragrant rice dish represent well wishes and hopes for the new year. Reshteh polo is served for Nowruz lunch or dinner. You can purchase the roasted Persian noodles from Iranian markets or online.",
            "Smoked fish is another traditional fish dish that graces a Nowruz feast. Although smoked white fish is traditional, many families serve a smoked fish of their choice like this smoked steelhead trout. Serve the smoked fish alongside sabzi polo (green herb rice) with plenty of Seville orange or lime wedges to squeeze over.",
            "On the eve of the last Wednesday of the year, Iranians gather together to celebrate Chahar Shanbeh Suri. Small bonfires are lit and people jump over the fire to bid farewell to the old year and welcome a new year. Aash-e reshteh is a hearty fresh herb, bean and noodle soup which is typically enjoyed on this night. The noodles in the soup are said to represent the many winding paths that life spreads before us.",
            "An Iranian meal would be incomplete without the presence of a fresh green herb and cheese platter. Fresh green herbs are enjoyed alongside every meal. Bread, cheese, and herbs also represent abundance and prosperity.",
            "At the Iranian table dishes are all served family-style. A bowl of maast-o khiar is ever present to help cut through the more rich dishes. You can also serve maast-o khiar as an appetizer with a side of bread, crackers, chips, or veggies.",
            "A tangy tomato, cucumber, and onion salad is a mainstay of an Iranian meal. Serve salad shirazi alongside a Nowruz feast for a fresh and crisp bite.",
            "This Northern Iranian marinated olive dish makes for a great appetizer or serve alongside the Nowruz meal. The combination of walnuts, pomegranate molasses, and spices make these olives irresistible.",
            "Sofreh Haft Seen is the decorative Nowruz table. It is set up with seven symbolic items starting with the Persian letter \"seen,\" or \"s.\" Desserts are also included on the Haft Seen to represent sweetness in the new year. Baghlava is one of the traditional sweets served for Nowruz.",
            "These Persian-style marzipan are shaped and named after mulberries. They are fragrant with the scent of rose water and very simple to prepare. Serve tut with a cup of tea.",
            "Walnut cookies are typically included on the Sofreh Haft Seen. They are perfumed with rose water and cardamom and are a perfect gluten-free treat.",
            "The 13th and final day of Nowruz is called Sizdah Bedar. It's considered unlucky to be indoors on this day and people head to parks and the outdoors and picnic in nature. Salad olivieh is considered the quintessential picnic sandwich. Make a batch and enjoy it with your favorite bread.",
            "This refreshing honey and vinegar drink is infused with fragrant mint. Sharbat-e Sekanjebin is touted for its healing benefits of cooling and restoring balance to the body. Serve Sekanjebin to cool and sweeten palates. It also makes for a great Sizdah Bedar picnic drink."

            "When people talk about Persian food, they usually throw around words like \"aromatic\" and \"herby.\" Those descriptors are absolutely true, but they don't even begin to encapsulate Persian cuisine. You definitely don't have to mysticize Persian food to understand it: our stews are squishy and comforting, our rice is fluffy with a coveted crispy layer, and we love our yogurt so much we even drink it. Cooking Persian food seems daunting, and \u2014 let's face it \u2014 you'll probably never make anything as good as a Persian grandmother, but with some practice, patience, and determination, you can become a confident Persian cook.",
            "Persian rice is far more than a mealtime staple: it's an artform. Tahdig, the caramelized, buttery layer that translates as \"bottom of the pot,\" is the best-known element of Persian rice, but it's not the only one that deserves recognition. Persian rice has an almost pillowy soft texture thanks to the great care that comes in preparing it. Before it even enters a boiling pot of water, it's already been washed at least three times to remove the starch and soaked for at least 30 minutes. Additionally, Persian rice is never \"just plain,\" and even the simplest rice recipe involves a fair amount of technique and seasoning, most notably saffron and salt. Persian rice dishes famously incorporate a variety of spices, vegetables, herbs, and even fruits, especially barberries or sour cherries.",
            "Persian Recipes to Try:",
            "Squishy food reigns supreme in Persian cuisine, and no dish better proves that than khoresh. Khoresh's name comes from the Farsi verb for \"to eat\" and translates as \"meal.\" It's a vague title, but given the variety of khoresh dishes, the name fits. For example, khoresh bademjan (Persian eggplant stew) and ghormeh sabzi (Persian herb stew) are vastly different, but still fit into the khoresh category. Khoresh dishes are usually referred to as stews thanks to their cooking method and texture.",
            "Koresh Recipes to Try:",
            "When Persian cuisine comes to mind, kebabs are likely the first foods conjured. Kebabs are standard Persian restaurant fare since they're made for crowds and don't need to spend time simmering. The most popular kebabs are barg (steak or lamb), jujeh (chicken), and koobideh (ground beef and/or lamb) \u2014 just try to pick a single favorite. But meat makes appearances in other Persian dishes, too, especially khoresh and soups like abgusht (which translates as \"meat water\").",

            "Traditional Persian desserts get their sweetness from floral notes, most notably rose and orange blossom, and usually incorporate dried fruit, nuts, or rice and a well-rounded array of spices. There's a strong sweet factor, but it's more of a natural sweetness rather than artificial or saccharine. Sholeh zard, Persian rice pudding, for example, gets its flavor from rosewater and saffron (which also gives it that unmistakable hue). We're also big on cream: bastani, rosewater and saffron ice cream, gets an extra touch of decadence from heavy cream, and every Persian household keeps a stash of French-style cream puffs on hand.",

And speaking of textures, Persian cuisine is also the home of tahdig \u2014 which takes the crispy crust of rice or potatoes that forms on the bottom of pans and casseroles and elevates it to an art form. With this collection, we've gathered together some of our favorite Persian recipes and Persian-inspired dishes, top-rated recipes that are simple enough to make during weeknights. Whether you're new to Persian cooking or you know and love it, these simple recipes will be great additions to your rotation.",
