            "The Mediterranean diet is the rare beast that successfully combines delicious food with the concept of a diet. In truth, the Mediterranean diet is more \"healthy way of life\" than dreary diet that you're forced to conform to. The Mediterranean diet does it by featuring whole foods that taste great with minimal preparations. And it sure doesn't hurt that a little red wine is part of the deal! Fresh, healthy, whole ingredients can, however, be expensive, particularly if they're also organic. But the good news is, on the Mediterranean Diet, you really can eat healthy on a budget. Here are some of the best budget-friendly recipes for the Mediterranean diet.",
            "Inexpensive tilapia fillets simmer with veggies, garbanzo beans, and Moroccan spices. \"Absolutely an EXCELLENT recipe,\" says Yummy2Tummy. \"My non-fish-loving husband wolfed this down in 5 minutes!\"",
            "This barley-based vegetable soup is hearty and filling for a song. It's even cheaper if you make your own broth. \"This is my kind of recipe,\" says Naneki. \"Healthy, flavorful, inexpensive, and easy.\"",
            "Canned salmon is a great choice for quick weeknight meals. These simple salmon patties put a healthy dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes. Sapphire says, \"I make this with any type of fish that is left over. I use ground oats instead of panko. They are great. We even used them as filling for taco night.\"",
            "Here's one that calls for inexpensive canned tuna. Chef John says, \"I love a classic meat sauce as much as the next half-Italian, but when I want something quick and easy for a weeknight meal, I reach for the tuna.\" And if you don't like fish? \"Then this is perfect,\" he says. \"The taste and texture is really closer to a veal sauce than one made with fish.\"",
            "A hearty Italian-style white bean soup with lots of fresh spinach. The white beans develop a wonderful creamy texture without any actual cream, so it's healthy, too. As Sarah puts it: \"All the delicious flavor of an unhealthy cream-based soup, but it's so good for you! Wonderful!\"",
            "This simple marinara sauce is the kind of satisfying comfort food that goes a long way for not a lot of money. \"Melting just a little cheese in the sauce adds great richness without overwhelming the tomatoes,\" says NMP. \"And it's easy to keep these ingredients stocked in the house! Makes for amazing leftovers!\"",
            "\"Fasolakia are Greek green beans stewed with olive oil and tomato, with a few pieces of potato added for good measure,\" says Diana Moutsopoulos. \"This is a main dish in Greece, not a side dish, and a prime example of plant-based eating! Good crusty bread is essential for mopping up the sauce and I always need to have a healthy chunk of feta on the side. Serve fasolakia warm or at room temperature for best flavor.\"",
            "\"Chakchouka (also called shakshouka) is a Tunisian and Israeli dish of tomatoes, onions, pepper, spices, and eggs,\" says Ben. \"It is similar to the Turkish dish 'Menemen' and to the Latin American breakfast dish 'Huevos Rancheros.' It's usually eaten for breakfast or lunch, but I think it's tasty anytime. And it's easy to make.\"",
            "Chicken combines with garbanzo beans, sweet potatoes, carrots, canned diced tomatoes, and seasonings. The Occasional Cooker calls it \"a delicious, easy, healthy, and budget-friendly one-dish meal. Excellent.\"",
            "This vegetarian minestrone soup is loaded with vegetables, kidney beans, and elbow macaroni. \"Slow cooking this soup allows all the flavors and spices to intensify,' says Laura.",
            "Ready in 15 minutes! You'll rub mackerel fillets with olive oil and paprika, top them with sliced lemons, and broil to beautiful. \"Holy Mackerel! Simple and yummy,\" says dbmojo. \"With a bonus: Mackerel is a sustainable fish.\"",
            "\"Cranberry beans, also called borlotti beans, are considered 'the poor man's meat' due to their nutritional value,\" says Buckwheat Queen. \"Creamy risotto made with fresh cranberry beans comes from the Lombardy region of Italy. With traditional flavors from the region, this risotto is bursting with flavor and healthy goodness. Cranberry beans are also called borlotti beans.\""

            "We're all about the Mediterranean Diet around here. Truth be told, it's more of a lifestyle than a typical, restrictive diet. The Mediterranean Diet puts the focus on healthy, whole foods that we love eating anyway. And it's kind to wine. What's not to love? It also takes well to slow, flavor-building preparations. With that in mind, we've put together a list of convenient slow-cooker recipes that feature Mediterranean Diet-friendly foods.",
            "\"Easy to make, flavorful, and creates a wonderful aroma to come home to,\" says Chris. You'll simply simmer a boneless turkey breast in the slow cooker with kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, Greek seasoning, and chicken broth brightened with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Pam made a couple adjustments: \"I added hot pepper rings for spice and a can of garbanzo beans. Near the end I added a can of artichoke hearts. Excellent!\"",
            "\"Yum, this is a delicious dinner,\" says Buckwheat Queen. \"The meat was so tender and the sauce this recipe creates is fantastic. Leftovers made an excellent sauce for pasta.\"",
            "In this vegetarian recipe, butternut squash, eggplant, zucchini, and frozen okra cook slowly in a flavorful, seasoned tomato sauce. \"A wonderful, wonderful stew that is easy to make,\" says Tiffany. \"The amazing flavors meld together so well and create such a surprisingly deliciously and unique dish!\"",
            "Strips of boneless, skinless chicken breast combine with garbanzo beans, sweet potatoes, carrots, canned diced tomatoes, and plenty of seasonings. \"Excellent,\" raves the Occasional Cooker. \"A delicious, easy, healthy, and budget-friendly one-dish meal. The flavors blended nicely and it smelled wonderful while it was cooking.\"",
            "This is an easy, excellent slow cooker recipe. Just mix the ingredients and let it cook. \"Delicious!\" says CookingForDummies. \"Spiced with cumin and coriander and flavored with tomato paste, this veggie-filled lentil stew will keep you warm for winter, and all year round! Good with a loaf of fresh-baked rustic bread! Vegetarian and vegan. Serve with a piece of bread for dipping.\"",
            "Here's a Spanish-style slow-cooker recipe that combines beef with olives, potatoes, garlic, and onions with sofrito, the flavorful Spanish tomato and green pepper-based condiment, which is a terrific cooking base. \"Very easy to make,\" says Caroline. \"It reminded me of cacciatore. Added carrots for that real beef stew feel. Delicious.\"",
            "Chicken cooks low-and-slow over a bed of pepperoncini, olives, and garlic in a creamy lemon sauce. \"The combination of flavors was wonderful,\" says Tiffiecancook. \"When the meat was gone, we saved the sauce and used it to spoon over rice and grilled pork chops a few days later. Cookingcub adds: \"This is an excellent low-cal dish without the sour cream,\" she says. \"I've made it with and without, and found it to be great either way.\"",
            "Chicken breast halves simmer slowly with spaghetti sauce, tomato paste, diced bell peppers, garlic, sliced mushrooms, and simple seasonings over low heat. \"My family loved this,\" says mvukas. \"The chicken was so tender and juicy. I held the mushrooms out and sauted them in butter and red wine.\"",
            "A hearty vegetarian minestrone soup that's loaded with vegetables and macaroni. \"Slow cooking this soup allows all the flavors and spices to intensify and delivers a delicious, hearty meal,\" says laura. \"Serve with a green salad and garlic bread for dipping.\"",
            "\"My family is from Greece and this lentil soup recipe is adapted from my traditional Greek lentil soup (fakes) recipe,\" says Diana Moutsopoulos. \"Since becoming a mom, finding time to cook has been hard, and this soup was a perfect slow cooker candidate. My husband and I think it tastes better than when made on the stove. Baby loves it, too!\"",
            "Seasoned chicken simmers with chickpeas, diced tomatoes, artichoke hearts, carrots, onions, and garlic. You'll add green beans and bell peppers toward the end of cooking. \"This delicious slow cooker meal of chicken and vegetables pairs up nicely with couscous and pita bread,\" says DebMCE4."

            "Want a quick and easy way to make good-for-you recipes? Well, here's how you can easily combine the healthful eating guidelines of the Mediterranean diet with the time-saving convenience of a multi-cooker. To get you started, I'll share a quick overview of the Mediterranean diet plus easy recipes you can make in your Instant Pot or pressure cooker.",
            "What is the Mediterranean diet? This popular healthy eating plan emphasizes whole foods, fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, healthy fats such as olive oil and avocado, and proteins such as chicken, seafood, nuts, beans, and legumes. In addition, you'll cut back on added sugars and processed foods, and eat dairy in moderation. You'll also cut back on added salt by using fresh and dried herbs to flavor your food instead.",
            "What are the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet? According to the Mayo Clinic, following this eating style can result in a longer life expectancy and lower rates of chronic diseases. In fact, it's been consistently ranked among the best diets overall.",
            "Do I have to eat only Mediterranean food on the Mediterranean diet? Not at all. There are many international cuisines that happen to fall within the guidelines, including Asian and Mexican food. Just be sure you make healthy ingredient choices, such as chicken or seafood instead of pork or red meat, olive oil instead of coconut oil or lard, low-sodium broths, and more herbs instead of added salt.",
            "\"I've made this recipe twice in the last month and we just love it! The Instant Pot makes it so easy. The only change I made the second time around was to cut the beans back by half a cup (this seemed to make the bean consistency less tough), increased the broth by a quarter cup and used a mixture of chicken breast and thighs. The flavor of this is amazing and it's just so hearty and perfect for chilly weather days!\" \u2014 Heidi Nelson Thomas",
            "To keep this easy recipe more in line with the Mediterranean diet, you can reduce the salt by cutting back on the bouillon cubes and bumping up the herbs. \"Flavors meld together like they've been simmering all day in a fraction of the time,\" says kirby1kat. \"A couple of small changes: I season the chicken prior to sauteeing. Instead of chicken bouillon cubes, I started using Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base as it contains much less salt and seems to have more flavor.\"",
            "\"I loved it! Super tasty, I did not change anything, and it was perfect!\" says Ildo76. \"I was worried about not putting salt into it, but it was great as is!\"",
            "Mediterranean diet guidelines suggest you eat fish twice a week. With this easy recipe, you'll be able to stock up and freeze salmon when it's on sale, and cook it easily from frozen. \"Salmon doesn't get much easier than this!\" says thedailygourmet. \"This turned out so moist and I like how it can be seasoned to individual preference.\"",
            "Be sure to choose low-sodium chicken broth for this easy recipe. While the skin might not be as crispy as what you'll get with an oven-roasted chicken, you'll still end up with plenty of tender chicken meat to use in recipes using rotisserie chicken.",
            "\"Tried it with my pressure cooker and it was delicious,\" says yocook. \"I also added 1/2 tsp of curry and a couple handfuls of frozen kale. We ate it over some brown rice and even my 6-yr-old loved it!\"",
            "\"You can have posole without having to stand over the stove for hours. Let your multi-functional pressure cooker do the work for you. Garnish with avocado slices, lime wedges, sliced radish, jalapeno slices, and/or tortilla strips,\" says Soup Loving Nicole. (May we suggest baked tortilla chips instead of fried?)",
            "\"I made it pretty much 'as is' other than I kept the olives whole and roughly chopped the onion. Delicious! I'll make it again,\" says Judy Good.",
            "Sort and rinse dried Great Northern beans, then add them to the Instant Pot with chicken broth, diced onions and garlic, bay leaves, and olive oil. Cook with high pressure 25 minutes. Then add carrots, celery, and prosciutto and cook for another 10 or 15 minutes. \"An Instant Pot\u00ae is certainly handy when it comes to dried beans,\" says Bibi. \"With less than 1 hour of active cooking time, this soup recipe is delicious and filling.\"",
            "\"My first thought was maybe I should cut back on the spices cuz it seemed so much, but I am certainly glad I did not!\" says CCCooks. \"Followed recipe & since I eat dairy free diet, used vegan butter & left out yogurt & this recipe is amazing! I'd give it 10 stars if I could...just that awesome!!\"",
            "This Moroccan-inspired chicken tagine is made for the Instant Pot, so dinner's ready in less than an hour! Chicken thighs combine with butternut squash, spinach, garlic, and spices.",
            "\"You don't have to soak beans when using an electric pressure cooker. Adjust the spices to your liking in this healthier, easy-to-make black bean soup that freezes well,\" says bd.weld.",
            "\"This delicious arroz-con-pollo-esque dish is so easy to make with the Instant Pot,\" says Diana71. \"Colorful, appetizing, and nourishing, this meal comes together in a flash and is chock full of flavor! I hope it becomes your next favorite weeknight meal. Squeeze lime or lemon wedges over if you like!\"",
            "\"Typical autumn flavors from Northern Italy mixed with gluten-free pasta will warm you on a cool evening,\" says Buckwheat Queen. \"Use any shape pasta you desire, even broken spaghetti works. If desired, the soup without the pasta will freeze wonderfully. Just cook the pasta in the soup once thawed.\"",

Essentially, clean eating is about eating more healthy foods and fewer unhealthy, heavily processed or refined foods and foods with added sugars and unhealthy fats.
