            "Labneh is a silky, creamy Lebanese cheese that goes with just about all of your favorite Mediterranean-inspired cuisine. You can easily make your own labneh from just a few simple ingredients: Greek yogurt, olive oil, and a couple pinches of salt. But whether you've made your own or bought it from the market, you'll love labneh's silky texture, and bright, tart flavors \u2014 and you'll want to enjoy it on absolutely everything. Here are a few places to start:",
            "1. Spread it on toast for a zingy morning treat. Add mashed avocado and a sprinkle of flake salt for a breakfast with great taste and satisfaction staying power.",
            "2. Connect with labneh's Middle Eastern origins by using it to top warmed pita bread, drizzling it with good-quality olive oil and dusting with a Lebanese spice blend.",
            "3. Make a labneh sandwich, adding leftover grilled meat or fish, mint leaves, chopped olives and a shake or two of za'atar, a spice blend made from thyme, sesame seeds, and ground sumac powder.",
            "4. Mound finished labneh in a bowl, then use the back of a spoon to make a swirl pattern on top. Pour on a generous splash of good-quality olive oil and add a sprinkling of Dukkah, the spice blend made with hazelnuts, sesame seeds, coriander, and cumin. Dip with raw veggies, crackers, or pita bread toasts.",
            "5. Let the yogurt drain until it's fairly firm, then roll into little balls, sprinkle with chopped herbs. Arrange on a platter and you've got a standout appetizer, called \"labneh korat\" or \"labneh makbouseh\" in Lebanese (If you're planning on serving these at a party, it's a good rule of thumb that each quart of yogurt will produce about six ounces of labneh).",
            "6. Store labneh balls in a mason jar, cover them with olive oil, add a few herbs, and you're ready to go with an impressive hostess gift.",

            "Located on the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea, Lebanon may be the smallest country in the Middle East, but it packs a powerful culinary punch. Lebanese food is the perfect example of the type of delicious, nourishing and healthy foods being promoted by those who follow the popular Mediterranean Diet.",
            "Is Lebanese cuisine the next big thing? According to Maeve Webster, president of Menu Matters, a consultancy focused on helping the food industry understand trends, \"It's a cuisine that carries a well-deserved healthy halo, because it uses any type of fat sparingly, has a very small presence of red meat (and then usually healthier and more sustainable choices like lamb or goat) and relies far more heavily on lean protein (particularly chicken), as well as plant-based proteins. It's a cuisine that fits well with produce-focused culinary innovation.\"",
            "Two Favorites",
            "You're already probably very familiar with two dishes that are a mainstay of Lebanese cuisines -- tabbouleh and hummus. Try this hugely popular staff pick version of Tabbouleh. Or add a modern twist by teaming your Tabbouleh with Edamame.",
            "If you've been buying hummus from the grocery store, you've been missing out on how easy and delicious it can be to prepare at home. Here's a version of Hummus that's easy to whip up in a blender or food processor. To make it as a main dish, try this Hummus Casserole, which layers the garbanzo puree with pita pieces, pine nuts, lemon juice, parsley, and ground beef.",
            "Meet Mezze",
            "The trend for shareable platters and snacks as meals just keeps growing, and Lebanese cuisine is a perfect fit for that focus. It's easy to pull together a few dishes and enjoy a Lebanese mezze, a word derived from mazeh, the Farsi word for \"taste.\"",
            "\"Mezze is the Lebanese form of tapas, and it's great to enjoy a series of small plates served as appetizers or drinks accompaniment with a few people across many plates,\" Webster says.",
            "Get started by making your own version of Lebanese cream cheese, called Labneh. It's a tangy, creamy accompaniment for dunking, dipping and sharing. Its perfect served with Manaaeesh Flatbread made with Za'atar, a spice blend of thyme, toasted sesame seeds, and sumac powder that's common in Lebanese kitchens. According to the recipe developer, it's \"a blend of many spices that will make your taste buds sing.\"",
            "Or try Fattoush, a light salad served with crunchy fried pita chips. Don't miss out on these crispy appetizer bites made with ground beef and lamb.",
            "Entrees",
            "As a main course, consider Lamb-Stuffed Zucchini (Koosa), which features a cinnamon-spiced tomato sauce. Or try Kibbeh, made from a blend of cooked bulgur wheat, mint and chopped onions combines with ground lamb and served with tahini. Lamb Shawarma is another popular choice, made from yogurt-marinated strips of lamb.",
            "Sweet Endings",
            "A delicious platter of Namoora (Basboosa) is the sweet, golden end to many traditional Lebanese meal. Or consider these authentic-tasting Arabic cookies.",
            "Check out all the tangy, tasty, and satisfying options in our collection of Lebanese Recipes."
