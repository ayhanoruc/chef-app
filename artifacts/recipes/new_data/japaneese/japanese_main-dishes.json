            "Surprisingly, I didn't hate it. In fact, I kind of liked it, and have identified the two main reasons why. It comes served on soft, buttery, slightly sweet Japanese milk bread, which is the perfect delivery system. Plus, the salad is bound together with a super savory mayonnaise that, as my old buddy Guy Fieri might say, would taste great on a flip flop. The most popular brand of this mayo is called Kewpie, which is pretty easy to find. But just in case, I show a fairly close version using commonly found pantry ingredients.",
            "Mine doesn't include MSG, which is one reason people line up for the stuff, but it's still very savory. Between that and the homemade milk bread, I almost forgot I was eating egg salad. So, whether you love egg salad and have always wanted to try this, or you're not a huge fan (but willing to taste the world's most famous version), I hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!",

            "When we talk about the greatest fried chicken recipes of all time, karaage has to be at or near the top of that list. This Japanese fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and intensely flavorful, which is even more impressive when you consider the fact that there is no skin or bones involved. However, not all karaage recipes are created equal, and the awesomeness is very much dependent on how and what you coat your chicken pieces in.",
            "For me, the secret to impossibly crispy karaage is pure potato starch. While I'm not known for my extensive, and exhaustive, recipe testing, I did many, many tests and experiments, using pretty much every possible combination of starch options; wheat flour, rice flour, cornstarch, et al., and potato starch was the winner. By the way, do not accidentally buy potato flour, which is not the same thing, and will not work the same. If you can't find potato starch, which you can, I think cornstarch is the next best option.",
            "Above and beyond the coating starch, the marinade also varies from recipe to recipe, but most contain what I've used here, give or take a splash of mirin, and you shouldn't hesitate to experiment with different ratios. No matter what you use, I think a 2-3 hours marinade is perfect, but like I said in the video, anywhere from 1 to 10 hours is considered appropriate. No matter how long your soak, I hope you find some potato starch, and give this incredible fried chicken a try soon. Enjoy!",
            "Mix garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, sesame oil, black pepper, cayenne, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl.",

            "Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Stir to coat with marinade. Toss 2 or 3 pieces at a time in the potato starch until evenly coated. Shake off any excess starch and place chicken on the wire rack. Repeat to dredge remaining pieces.",
            "Tap the rack on the baking sheet to remove any loose chunks of starch, then transfer the baking sheet and rack of chicken to the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.",
            "Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
            "Without crowding, lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry, tossing occasionally, until cooked through and the outside is crunchy and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken.",
            "If you can't find mirin, you can use sake plus an extra teaspoon of white sugar. You can use cornstarch instead of potato starch, but don't use potato flour! It's not the same as potato starch.",
            "For crispier, darker karaage that's made in two steps and great for a party, try the double-fry method! Follow instructions to Step 6. Fry chicken as directed in step 7, but only fry for 1 \u00bd to 2 minutes. Remove to a rack and let cool to room temperature. Finish by frying at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 2 more minutes. Chicken can be refrigerated until the second fry.",
